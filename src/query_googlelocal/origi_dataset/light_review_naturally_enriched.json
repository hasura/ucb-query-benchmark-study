This service includes chromotherapy, crystal grids, sound therapy and aroma therapy. I personally always feel like I have good energy flow but I wanted to experience this therapy to insure all my chakras are open without blockages. I‚Äôm a writer and it‚Äôs important for me to feel balanced for ultimate creativity. The closest I had come to Chakra balancing was wearing a bracelet! Beauty Divine is a master! She is very knowledgeable, professional and punctual. She explained the entire process during the consultation so I knew what to expect and then set up the most amazing environment for you to truly experience the healing. I was extremely relaxed. She has a very gentle touch and makes you feel very comfortable. Once I was lying on the table breathing the aromas, I could feel vibrations from the crystals immediately! This combined with the chromotherapy and the sound therapy, I literally felt like I was traveling to a different realm. I had to squeeze the balls in my hands to remind me I was still here! I allowed myself to fully let go and let Beaty Divine do the healing. I loved every aspect of this experience. I feel centered, balanced and an overall sense of purpose.

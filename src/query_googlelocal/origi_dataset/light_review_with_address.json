The whole staff was incredible and unbelievably over the top, friendly, helpful and nice. It's rare to find service like this these days. I am a VERY hard customer to please. Nothing EVER goes right for me and being in business for my self I am extremely critical of any little thing that goes wrong, from a crooked uniform, personal appearance, a slip of the tongue, a roll of the eyes, or a hint of a bad attitude none of that was present when dealing with this organization. They bent over backwards in being available, handling special requests, dealing with my problems, last minute changes and making me feel like I was their best and only customer on the entire mountain. Like a few of the others I rarely write reviews, however these people more than exceeded expectations and totally blew me away. I want to go out of my way to tell you this place is - PHE-NOM-A-NAL!!!","pics":null,"resp":{"time":1573504300892,"text":"Thanks so much for your business and the wonderful review.

You will have to help yourself until you bother an employee for assistance, only to realize that the employee probably has little to no experience with paint.  I was able to look past the poor customers service because some of our friends had mentioned a few colors from Dunn-Edwards.  We were finishing up a project and I stopped by to grab some swatches, but they had already locked the doors.  It was 12:55 PM according to my iPhone, a very accurate time.  The employee standing there, probably the one who had locked the door, would not turn his head.  I would have been in the store 3 minutes prior, but I had to drive around to find parking because they've marked off about 10 empty spots in the front of their store for \"employees only\".  As I walked to my car, I noticed employees walking out of the back and hopping in their cars, parked in the unmarked spots.  Next time, I'll just go to Lowes.

However, on my end- I was charged $40. $30 + a $10 tip I do EVERY SINGLE TIME I\u2019ve gone for the past 3 years. Over the years they have changed owners and I. Between the 11th and today, the 21st they have again switched their name. I was kind enough when I left on June 11th to leave them my credit card info to be fair that they were paid accordingly. Upon being told my card was declined today, she proceeds to pull out a piece of paper with my name and CC # and said I was going to be charged that amount as well. I refused to pay for a service 2 times and showed her proof of the initial payment that they indeed did take that money from my account. PLUS today\u2019s chair massage. She calls the boss, puts him on speaker and he SCREAMS at me- who knows what the hell he said. I check my account and they used my cc # I had written down and charged me for the last visit, plus today\u2019s! I am LIVID. I have been a loyal customer, at least 4-5 times a month and always a very generous tipper. They will never see me again. I have now had to cancel my credit card, because they didn\u2019t SHRED IT two weeks ago and attempted to unlawfully charge me again. Well, my bank has blocked them and they\u2019ve lost a customer. During my massage a \u201cgentleman\u201d walked in and asked if anyone was \u201cavailable to take a shower afterwards\u201d.... hmmmm.... gross.

These doors were used often in the 90's and I had heard they went out of business.  We had a repair done this week and I was very sad to see a porvene door show up.  They have an incredibly cheap hasps that gets more complaints than any other door we have used in over 40 years of development.  They are difficult to open or close, easy to cut with a bolt cutter, and over time tend to push the railing up and leave a gap between the ground and the door that increases over time.\n\nI sincerely wish the company would have stayed closed.  Customers do not know how to open the hasp at first, you have to show them.  Also they create more customer service issues and repair\/work order than any other door by triple.  Please never use them-- if you also hate these doors I would love to hear your rant... mutual hatred for a terrible product is good for the soul.\n\nFinally, I attached a photo from a repair a few months ago.","pics":[{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipPlxFa0107ZiD53-YrRf1K0IMYnymNCJvHM65Zf=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}],"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x809ad7b6234f1ff9:0xe5622114044a3a90","address":"Porvene Doors, 4119 S Market Ct # D, Sacramento, CA 95834"}

Mostly, I appreciate the dedication to: the solid preaching of the Bible, the rich heart of worship, the value placed on children, and the way my family is loved so well.\n\nWhen we moved to the Roseville area, my husband & I knew we wanted Word-rich messages (as opposed to topical sermons with Bible verses sprinkled in here & there.) I love how the sermons- usually given by Pastor Mark South- dig deep into the text of the Bible, often leaving me wishing my mind could hold more info.\n\nThe majority of the corporate worship songs occur after the preaching. I love this approach, as my heart is ready & able to respond to what the Lord has just revealed through the Word, and I am given the opportunity to do so through the singing of worship songs. (Also, there are a TON of gifted musicians here!)\n\nHaving young kiddos, I greatly appreciate that Origin Church values children. My kids are hearing Gospel-centered teachings each week and are undoubtedly loved.\n\nSince we're not from the area, it has been important to me that we find a community of people who love Jesus and can love my family through the ups and downs of life. At Origin, I have friends who have laughed with me, cried with me, prayed for me, and lovingly corrected me...where I come from, that's called family.","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x809b2063472fb85b:0x7d6aad89aefc4aea","address":"Origin Church, 4600 Winding Way, Sacramento, CA 95841"}

And this isn't at the expense of other helpful ministries within the church, such as a weekly women's Bible study and occasional events for the men.

They have a menu with a good amount of tasting options and believe me when I say they all taste REALLY good. The Strawberry Mojito was excellent, I definitely recommend starting there if its your first time with kombucha.\nLocal Roots looks and smells like its brand new, and from my opinion they have made the space into a very nice place to come after work and enjoy some downtime. They have Jenga and Cornhole for entertainment as well as a couple TVs and plenty of seating space.\nDefinitely a spot I will be visiting again soon and I would recommend this place as a must visit spot.","pics":[{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipN4_eVPu3WoNWbZByLsRGSkHqwthY6l3eWHABjN=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipMaLV5mSDX30UGMgabQ3OrTV1y9tWYgIBZWfA8P=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipMel_ioP-JdQrlnjtiyIj8reU8IGBpObccscBkp=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipP_S6ii4a_XSvEValBEtmuTwgkvvc2qxfRgeTK1=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipO-Mrhv6JS__IeDz6sGkosbAflDsdLIbAKbn1Sr=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipPzQAhXjGEmU6XBB2V9DiiVuWAXultvFvbvz9e-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}],"resp":{"time":1557756535895,"text":"Thanks for the great review Andrew!

A quick look at some of their reviews assured me that they seemed to be a solid, reputable company.  I made an inquiry about their service area on their website and received a quick, personal response via text.  We set up a date\/time for the installation and their prices were quoted to me up front.  The technicians (Chris and his associate) communicated with me on the install date and since they were running early, asked if I they could come by a half-hour early.  (<--- super great in my book because I have waited many hours for service people to show up during a 4-6 hour timeframe!)\nThey arrived right on time, and they completed the assembly within an hour.

I had a repairman come out last year, and he attempted to fix the problem. The metal-on-metal squealing noise improved a little bit, but never completely went away.\n\nOver time, the screeching noise became worse and worse. I was about ready to junk the machine, and buy a new one, when I saw an online ad for Fitness Machine Technicians. So, I decided to give them a try.\n\nChris came out and completely disassembled the elliptical machine. He was quickly able to find the cause of the noise, and he fixed it on the spot. He also cleaned, lubricated, and calibrated the machine.\n\nA few days later, I got back on the machine and was very pleased that it no longer made any noise at all! Also, the action of the machine was much smoother than it ever was before, even when it was brand new.\n\nI cannot say enough good things about Chris, or Fitness Machine Technicians. I was ready to send this elliptical machine to the junkyard, and now it is like a brand new machine. I am completely satisfied with the quality of the service that was provided, by the professionalism of the technician (Chris), and by the very reasonable cost of this extensive repair job. I will definitely have Chris come back for all future routine preventive maintenance, and any other needed repairs, from now on!","pics":null,"resp":{"time":1598728893483,"text":"I'm so glad that we were able to save your machine, and make your workouts quieter - thank you for taking the time to share your experience, and we'll look forward to working with you again!"},"gmap_id":"0x80dc750924d7774f:0x7feef88597477a33","address":"Fitness Machine Technicians, 2323 Main St Unit D12, Irvine, CA 92614"}

I clip my nails and grow them so all I was looking for was a quick trim and buff. I felt like I constantly had to correct her on the clipping as one side obviously looked rounded and the other squared. Just seems like it shouldn't be a detail to miss. I mean who doesn't want their nails to look even? As for my grandmother she had her toes done and the associate who did them accidently hit the fresh paint on the big toe and \"fixed\" it. Looked terrible. If you take a chunk out just remove the nail polish and start over for an even coat. Very disappointing as this should be some basic 101 skills.","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x80dce8b37f4132fb:0xd392d6512a804ac7","address":"Excel Hair & Nails, 26895 Aliso Creek Rd Suite D, Aliso Viejo, CA 92656"}

I finally had decided to re-decorate my home. I went and bought new furniture for my living room, dinning room, my home office and guest room and even thou the new furniture looked great I still needed that something to complete the rooms. A friend of mine had mentioned that she had just bought a rug for her mom's living room and recommended that I go to Taba Rug Gallery store. She said he carried  gorgeous rugs and very reasonable prices and that I would definitely find what I was looking for there. But I still wanted to go shop around and look at other rug stores, but they were either to expensive or they didn't have what I was looking for. I'm so glad I took my friends advise.  The owner's name is Taba my friend told  me that he's been in business for more then 25 years and if you ever want to know about the quality or anything about the rugs that he is very knowledgeable on all the different types.  When I arrived at Taba's gallery I knew right away this was the place I would buy my gorgeous rugs from. Taba makes you feel right at home! from the moment you walk in.  I had taken pictures of my rooms and took them with me so I could pick what I was looking for and still I couldn't make up my mind which rug I should put in which room....so he offer to come to my home and bring several of the rugs to try in each of the rooms and he was right that's the best way you can see what looks good in each room!. I am so happy with my new decorated rooms. I think they look awesome!. Thanks! to Taba for helping me pick the rugs that would complete my rooms.

(More about that later). I was on a budget but wanted to find 100% hand knotted or machine woven wool rugs. I knew these rugs, especially hand knotted ones, could easily run in the many thousands which we could not afford, but I kept looking online and in local stores to see if I could find something my family could afford, because I learned these would be the least toxic rugs (we have 2 young kids). I tried buying one online but learned the hard way that there are many nuances so it's best to see the rugs in person so you know and can feel what you are getting. I wasn't even sure if it would be worth my time to try to find a wool rug in La Jolla (I assumed things would just be too pricey) but when I called the store to ask if they carry 100% hand knotted or machine woven wool rugs (avoid hand tufted rugs and be watchful of 'hand woven' rugs - need to ask more questions to clarify what that means), Taba was sooo friendly and welcoming and said he would help me find something that would meet my budget. When I walked into the store, I saw Steven Tyler walking out! It was hard not to recognize him with his multi colored feather hat : ). Taba greeted me and I asked him, \"Is that Steven Tyler from Aerosmith?!\" Taba showed me the rug Steven picked out and said Steven would be back in 15 minutes to pick it up. When he finished ringing up his purchase, Taba helped me look through his selection of rugs. He carries a wide variety of styles and sizes and it was easy to find 2 rugs that would look great in our home and ended up being cheaper than I expected (literally got 2 rugs for almost the same price of 1 rug I was looking at another rug store). He took the time to explain the difference in quality and what to look for in a good rug and did not rush or pressure me in any way. It was such a pleasant experience. When Steven Tyler came back in to get his credit card and rug, he looked rushed and irritated (news people and cameras were following him). I couldn't help but ask Steven for a photo but he said he was really in a hurry. I watched in amazement as Taba immediately greeted him again and engaged him immediately in conversation. Steven was so at ease and chit chatting with Tana that not only did I end up taking a photo of Taba with Steven but Taba also took a photo of me with Steven! I was one happy customer! Whether you are a wealthy celebrity or regular walk in customer on a budget, Taba will do his best to take great care of you. I love supporting family owned businesses!","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x80dc03fb43ada4fd:0x2d4a8e18338db73a","address":"Taba Rug Gallery, 7848 Girard Ave, La Jolla, CA 92037"}

I\u2019m a writer and it\u2019s important for me to feel balanced for ultimate creativity. The closest I had come to Chakra balancing was wearing a bracelet! Beauty Divine is a master! She is very knowledgeable, professional and punctual. She explained the entire process during the consultation so I knew what to expect and then set up the most amazing environment for you to truly experience the healing. I was extremely relaxed. She has a very gentle touch and makes you feel very comfortable. Once I was lying on the table breathing the aromas, I could feel vibrations from the crystals immediately! This combined with the chromotherapy and the sound therapy, I literally felt like I was traveling to a different realm. I had to squeeze the balls in my hands to remind me I was still here! I allowed myself to fully let go and let Beaty Divine do the healing. I loved every aspect of this experience. I feel centered, balanced and an overall sense of purpose.

When I called to check in on the status of the car I was given a breakdown of the malfunctioning systems and the cost of the work.\nRodney quoted me the following:\n~$830:\n$154 x2 (each diagnostic test)\n$330 for cam shaft sensor replacements (2)\n$190 for an oil change (full synthetic)\n\nI was pretty shocked at the overall cost of the analysis and repairs considering there was no sign of serious issue.\nI called Jiffy Lube immediately, just to compare prices and they quoted me ~$110 for an oil change. That's an $80 increase from a local competitor.\n\nI asked my stepfather to call the shop and ask for a similar breakdown. After finding out that I was related to a longtime patron of theirs, (with many referrals and many serviced cars), Rodney informed me that he had spoken to the manager and they would void all of my costs. Considering my experience with this shop, that didn't sound coincidental.\n\nWhen my stepfather spoke to Rodney, they gave him the same breakdown of costs but also added in that my front brakes were very low and needed to be replaced. This was surprising considering I had replaced my rear brakes earlier that year. I found this unacceptable that Rodney gave additional information, seemingly important, to my stepfather but neglected to give me, the car owner the same information.\nLong story short, I took my car to a different shop and they gave me a similar diagnosis and fix list with much different prices.\n\nI only needed 1 cam shaft sensor replaced (not 2, as the invoice had stated), my rear brakes were at 6mm (not 2mm, as they stated), and the oil change was done for ~$110.\nTotal paid: $300\n\nLastly, I asked my mechanic to check over everything - just to be sure. They found that my front brakes (installed by Timmons around March 2020), were not pinned in fully - which can be dangerous. My mechanic corrected Timmons' error in my rear brakes and for free.\n\nToday, Rodney gave me a call to find out if I wanted to move forward with the repairs not knowing that I had already repaired my car. I asked him to reiterate the information about my front brakes again, and he verbally confirmed that they were low. In short, he lied.","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x80856140074870ef:0xc7604e373035580f","address":"Timmons Auto & Truck Repair, 2855 Contra Costa Blvd D, Pleasant Hill, CA 94523"}

{"user_id":1.053047968e+20,"name":"Betsy Fessler","time":1443110043115,"rating":1,"text":"Not wanting to write this at all.  Completely wish things had been handled completely different.  Hate the time this is taking to try to resolve.\n\nWe brought our motorhome to Timmons per the request of a potential buyer. They wanted it evaluated by a mechanic.  An appointment was made, and we were requested to have it there by 9 a.m.  Despite the fact that we were coming from the south bay, my husband had it there by 8:30.\n\nI arrived by 10 a.m. to pick him up, and our RV still had not been taken back for its inspection.  So we went for breakfast and some shopping. 4 more hours went by, and my husband was starting to go crazy (the shop said they would try to have it done by noon).  So at 2 p.m., my husband called, and the shop told us the evaluation was finished.  It was finished, but they never called us to pick it up.  Huh.\n\nWe came to pick it up, and Dave had to ask my husband how to operate our leveling jacks.  The e-brake was not on, which is required to operate them.  There is a reminder pre-printed on the switch panel.  An RV mechanic should have knowledge of that.\n\nTimmons also raised a concern to the buyer (not us) about the headers.  Our coach has a Banks Power kit.  We assume he was questioning whether or not they were legal.  Not only is it smog legal, it was installed in California by Camping World, and the most recent smog inspection was 3 months ago.  The smog report was in a folder we left in the coach next to the driver's seat.  And if that wasn't convenient, it could have be verified by quickly looking online, calling Banks Power, looking at the manuals that were in the RV, or even asking us before raising unnecessary concern with the customer.\n\nI was watching when our coach was being delivered to the front.  It was time to drive home. I noticed that the turn out of their lot was very tight, and the right rear of our coach was extremely close to the adjoining building.  However, I thought nothing about it, until the next morning.\n\nThe next morning, my husband walked outside to notice that the right rear corner of our coach had been dented and scraped.  My husband called the service adviser and left a message.\n\nThe service adviser didn't call back.  The owner Dave called back, and my husband explained what he had found.  The owner questioned it, which we found insulting.  We had repaired minor damage in that corner prior, and it was flawless prior to taking it to Timmons.  Dave then seemed to speak as if he already knew that the damage was there.  If that is the case, they weren't going to say anything, and hoped that we wouldn't find it.  Not very honest.\n\nDave asked for photos of the damage, which we emailed.  We were never called back.  So we called to verify Dave'e email address.  The lady answering (Dave's wife?) was rude, assuming we were solicitors.  She didn't want to give Dave's correct email address.  After finally agreeing to give it, we re-sent the photos, and still didn't hear back.  So two days later, my husband called in the morning and left Dave a voicemail.  Still no call back.\n\nWe, until recently, owned a substantial body shop in the south bay.  We dealt with the occasional difficult customer with false accusations of damage. We always had 4 corner pics of the car, and could usually prove the customer wrong.  If we couldn't, we fixed it.  It was the right thing to do.  We always wanted our customers to be happy.  We always wanted to prevent those damaging bad reviews.\n\nI have friends in Concord who are regular customers, and bring their RV's to Timmons.  Upon hearing of our experiences, they are very surprised to hear about the level of customer service that we received while we were at Timmons.  They have asked us to keep them updated on how the issue with the body damage is resolved.  I am sorry to say that so far I have no good news for them.\n\nWe are left with an RV that is now worth less than when we brought it to Timmons.  Also, we have not heard back from the potential buyer, partially due to concerns that were raised based on seeming lack of knowledge about RV's.","pics":null,"resp":{"time":1583364742152,"text":"Betsy, since we are finally able to respond to these, we wanted to, even though this is from a long time ago.

He is always 30-45 minutes late to his appointment.  Rudely he doesn\u2019t apologize and down talks to the patient. NO BEDSIDE MANNERS.\nOn my last visit I asked him to inject shots under my eyebrow for a better lift. He completely disregarded my ask and injected more shot on my forehead which equaled to more money. I paid $360 , $12 a unit which was the most I have ever injected!!\n\nFew days later my eyelids started drooping and I looked puffy and tired. The wrinkles on my forehead were still there!  I did contact his office and expressed my concern and dissatisfaction and was given an appointment an hour from the time I called. I had to leave work hoping he will correct the mess he did on my face.  Again after waiting 45 minutes for him to see me, he abruptly entered the room and start talking rudely to me stating that nothing is wrong!!! Then he yelled at his nurse why my prior to injection shots were not handed to him. Then he stormed out of the room and nurse followed him and shut the door on my face. At the time I was shocked of his unprofessional and rude behavior.  So I peaked my head out and asked the nurse what is going on. The dr screamed from across the hall way saying\u201d GET BACK IN THE TOOM AND SHUT THE DOOR. CANT YOU UNDERSTAND WE ATE GETTING THE PHOTOS. GET BACK IN A THERE.   This was the final draw for me.

The receptionists told me multiple times that my appointments would be covered by my insurance and that the only thing I had to pay out of pocket would be the copay. This is the case with my primary care doctor, so it didn\u2019t seem out of the ordinary. They had my insurance information at this point, and I specifically asked (multiple times) because I didn\u2019t want any surprises bills. Well, I got surprise bills. Make sure you check THROUGH YOUR INSURANCE about your coverage at this office. Do not trust their receptionists, they have no idea what they\u2019re talking about. Also, be wary of parking! The street parking is very limited and I got a parking ticket on my second visit that I am contesting due to misplaced and unclear signage. Several other cars had these tickets on them as well when I came out, so if you are unsure about the signs, I suggest opting for safety and parking elsewhere.","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x80c298276cf4f991:0xb668455a514e875","address":"Encino Dermatology & Laser: Alex Khadavi MD, 16260 Ventura Blvd #140, Encino, CA 91436"}

Let me tell you\u2014 the B-12 injections at this San Jose location are the best. B-12 is essential for healthy cell function, and many people in the US overlook it (search for Pernicious Anemia). I highly recommend checking this place out! This clinic is also the MOST beautiful one I\u2019ve been to\u2014 and I really have been to quite a few over the years for vitamin injections. The clinic is really quite cozy and well-kept, and the staff is friendly! COVID precautions have been set up as well.\n\nFor the appetite suppressants, they are the usual ones that can be prescribed. They actually have A LOT of options and medication combinations to make the most of individualized programs. The prices are reasonable for the Bay Area\u2014 definitely on the pricier side for the state\u2014 but decent for the Bay Area.\n\nFor my progress, I lost 10 pounds in September 2020, so I\u2019m on track with the overall program. I would like to note that the recommended timeline for programs such as these are incredibly variable, usually 3-6 months depending on personal goals. They DO require dedication and maintenance!

After looking around for the right weight loss doctor, I decided on Dr Syverain after seeing other patient reviews.  To be honest, I basically was looking for a fast way to loose the weight that was dragging me down.  When I told him about my busy mobile schedule, he prescribed for me appetite suppressants and B12 vitamin shots as a quick solution.  Overall, I have to say I do feel happier and confident moving around after six months of treatment.  I really value the health advices he gave me to care myself in the long haul.

He can draw anything you suggest and he will get it exactly how you imagine it. Then throughout the whole process he makes sure you\u2019re comfortable, relaxed and able to keep going. During the tattoo you can just chat and have a nice convo, or if you need to relax he will just focus on the tattoo and not even mind, so he is great for all those introverted snd extroverted people. He is also very nice about working with your budget. You can tell him how much you have and he will completely work around that.\nSecondly, just his tattoo machine is the best because it is so quite and feels super nice compared to other tattoo machines. For me it felt the same as someone drawing on my arm with a fine tip sharpie.\nThird, the atmosphere is really nice. All the artists seem really nice and welcoming. The shop feels like a place of happy times with people being hyped about their new art or just hanging out with pals.\nOverall this was by far the best experience I had getting a tattoo.

I selected Acuity Eye Group in Tustin simply because they took my insurance and it was close by. But the truth is, I had a wonderful experience. Communication was great leading up to the appointment. The check-in process went smoothly. I was called to the back by Miesha (not sure I am spelling her name correctly). She immediately made me feel at ease and she performed all of the up front exam work (drops, images, vision testing, etc.) with precision, while making me feel very comfortable. From there I met with Dr. Boeckmann who performed a detailed exam, reviewed my eye images, explained the condition of my eyes to me, and we discussed my options for future vision improvement. She was clear, made things easy for me to understand, and I felt like I was being treated like a family member. Dr. Boeckmann was personable, trustworthy, and made me feel like she really cared. I am sure that she does this with all of her patients. If you are at all hesitant about see an eye doctor, as I was, I strongly recommend Acuity Eye Group in Tustin and Dr. Boeckmann.

As you can see he had to jackhammer up my concrete and solder new copper!\n\nAbove that he was super clean and even put shoe booties on to come in and check my toilets that  I complained had recently started running and fixed those In minutes!  Seriously great guy and great service!\n\nThey also used an app to let me know he was on his way with his picture and eta...I love Technology!!","pics":null,"resp":{"time":1604000536449,"text":"Thank you Melissa!"},"gmap_id":"0x80dcb98e0470faa3:0x36e436d9eeeed03e","address":"J & T Plumbing Pros, 3380 La Sierra Ave, Riverside, CA 92503"}

He explains what he is going to do before he does it, and gives you options, if there are any.  His fees are reasonable and he doesn't say any more work needs to be done than what you called him to repair. He also is careful to not damage anything around the repair, arriving with clean towels and shoe covers.\n\nCall Jenny for pleasant, clear communication and knowledgeable responses to schedule a prompt eappointment.  (She even sends out a map link to tell you when Tyler is arriving, plus it has a picture of Tyler so you KNOW it's him when he arrives.)\n\nI'll be calling him to install Toto toilets after the first of the year. He knows the \"ins and outs\" of Toto toilets already, and he will get the toilets for you. YAY!\n\nADDENDUM:  Tyler installed 2 Toto toilets this week. There were no problems with ordering them; the toilets were in new condition, installation went smoothly and quickly. Tyler even camera-ed the pipes under the toilet all the way to the street. No roots; no blockages.\nHe also found out, on a 3rd toilet, why the water level was low in the bowl. The previous plumber used a part inconsistent with the Toto toilet. While noticing that, he also noticed instead of getting the proper handle to flush the toilet, the previous plumber bent the inside bar, which was ready to break soon.  A future plumbing disaster was diverted!\n\nAs a plumber, he is repairing a gas line, too. The kitchen stove has a slow ignition time, so Tyler will remove the current regulator, as houses have low pressure gas lines that do not require a regulator. It is safe to do so and will allow for quicker ignition. (He knows the building codes!)\n\nHe can also work on leaking water pipes from the city's meter (the city\/county is responsible for the meter itself and to the street) to the house.\n\nJ & T Plumbing Professionals are reliable, cost affordable,  plumbing problem preventable through maintenance service, and VERY customer service oriented.

I went to pick up 10 - 3'x6' metal signs and one of the signs did not end up in my order. I was told I would have to drive the 2.5 hrs back down south to pick up the one sign because they did not offer shipping. Understandable though, it is a large sign but I figured some sort of compensation may help. Upon talking with customer service I was told that \"not equipped to pick up the order because of its size\" although I had 9 other signs of the same size. I was told that the truck size was not the issue so apparently they assumed that I couldn't physically pick up the sign and loaded it into the truck for me although this is something that \"they do not normally do.\" The man had looked at my order, and then looked to see if I had a vehicle of the correct size and immediately after said he would be right out with my order. Never once was I informed that I needed to go and physically pick it up myself or I would have. Customer service told me they provided me with a piece of cardboard to help the signs slide into the truck.  These signs were $75 a piece and had a thin piece of plastic wrap over the front which is why they would not slide on each other. Even the man helping me load the order said \"I'm not sure why they wrapped it like this.\" So apparently providing the piece of cardboard was way over the line for them.  I always order large orders through this company but will be taking my business elsewhere simply because of the attitude of the customer service representative I spoke with.","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x80c2da6fbe9a996b:0xdefa758f030041b4","address":"B2Sign, Inc., 462 Humane Way, Pomona, CA 91766"}

She worked to resolve the issue and offered a reprint of my order. We are very pleased with the resolve and hope this was an isolated incident and that we can continue to work with B2Signs. We are still a bit leary given all the bad reviews but knowing how they operate with their automated system will hopefully shed a little light on how to work with them in the future. Again, we are happy with the resolve and hope going forward, to have a better experience in the future.\n\nBad customer service. My husband attempted to order from them and had some difficulty with their templates. He reached out to them via their live chat system and dealt with a very rude person who was of no help to him in the process. After several attempts at trying to get assistance from them, they basically told him sorry he was having problems and since he couldn't figure it out maybe he should just go somewhere else. He asked to speak with a manager and was told the same thing. I was able to resolve the problems he was having with his artwork and we placed the order for a table throw. Originally it had been rejected twice because he had left the template lettering in place. I deleted all of it but in the instructions it said it was okay to leave the dotted lines from the template. We sent the art work in again and it was approved and accepted. 5 days later we got our table throw and they had printed their template lines on to our product. Once again we got in touch with them via live chat. The first person we spoke to, Paula, was very rude and told us it was our fault but that she would have a manager call us. Never got a call. Contacted them again via live chat and got someone else that was nice and more apologetic and said she would have a manager contact us. A manager finally contacted us over the phone and said there was nothing he could do about it. And refused to redo the table throw or even offer a discount. They were adamant that it was our fault and not theirs even though they rejected previous artwork with template wording on it and then approved the one with the template lines. This company is not pleasant to deal with whatsoever and will not even attempt to fix and issues with their product.","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x80c2da6fbe9a996b:0xdefa758f030041b4","address":"B2Sign, Inc., 462 Humane Way, Pomona, CA 91766"}

{"user_id":1.006570968e+20,"name":"Erin Jeffrey","time":1537815384090,"rating":2,"text":"Unbelievable. I have been using B2 for some time now (years). Mostly for banners, but occasionally for table covers. They have always been fast, affordable, and I have found the online software easy to use. I work for a local print shop in Houston and do graphics and layout for customers here, so this is not something I am new to or unfamiliar with.\n\nToday, I placed an order for a 5'x5' banner. When the order went it, it submitted as a 1'x1' banner. The price should have been a flag for me to look at the order closer, but I didn't think about it, so that is on me; however, when I uploaded the artwork, usually, if it is overset, too small, or the wrong size, the system will flag it and you will have to approve the size discrepancy. That did not happen. I got a green light that the artwork fit correctly, so I submitted it and went on my way.\n\nShortly after, the order confirmation came into our color department showing an order for a 1'x1' banner. I was notified and I immediately got on to the website to cancel the order. Unfortunately, it was too late to cancel and because B2 Sign wasn't open yet, I couldn't call customer service. Thinking I had made the error, I got back on to the website and went to place an order for the correct size and when I did, I realized the software wasn't calculating the size the correctly. Even though I had entered 5' x 5', the square foot calculator beneath the dimension fields showed 1'x1'. So I took a picture of it. I called B2 Sign once they opened and the customer service girl who handled the call said that it was already sent to print, they couldn't cancel the order, and all they could do is refund me the shipping, so I asked to speak to a manager. They were so swamped with calls that they told me they would have a manager call me back.\n\nTo their credit, a manager did get back with me relatively quick (an hour) and I told him what happened. This is where I have issues. This guy wouldn't even listen to what I had to say, he tells me that I put the order in wrong (even though I have been ordering banners from them regularly for years without issue), that I must have walked away from the computer mid-order which is why it switched back to a 1'x1' default (I did not walk away...), that he would refund this order the one time as a courtesy, but if I made the mistake again, (yes....he said that) he would not refund me again. When I tell him I have a picture of the software malfunction he insinuates I am a liar because he is looking at the software and it isn't doing it for him.\n\nI have included the picture and you can see that I had hit enter after putting in the desired dimensions because, it had calculated a price. Notice the 1'x1' calculation underneath. If I had not hit enter, the price field would have remained blank as shown in the alternate photo.\n\nYou know...I understand this business and the way customers who don't know what they are doing can cost you money. Sometimes, you have to stand your ground. And I appreciate the refund. BUT when a customer that has been with you for years has a problem, it doesn't do to insult them. There are other printers closer to home that I can use that are equally inexpensive. I have been prefential to B2 because I tend to be loyal to vendors if I like them, but it looks like I don't have a reason to be that way now. And the only reason why I am not giving them one star is because of all the time before that they did a good job. Goes to show, all it takes is one time of bad to ruin ALL the good.","pics":[{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipObvtrdt9GopqVc20-MKY98KRfrv-aAc2HVolsE=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipOMtng73WZJFMmO_oy4r5tHj1AnXqjwTq23GuSl=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}],"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x80c2da6fbe9a996b:0xdefa758f030041b4","address":"B2Sign, Inc., 462 Humane Way, Pomona, CA 91766"}

We contacted me to via email at which time they told us to place a claim with them and they would provide us with the ability to do so we never heard anything back and running a very busy business there have been some time that went by before the customer mentioned replacing these posters. 5 months after making the posters the customer is seeing the lamination come off of every poster these posters were put on the side of a building in a frame that gently clamps down onto the poster. We recently submitted the claim for a second time of which the first time they deny ever speaking to us. This claim was turned down because their reasoning is the frame itself has put pressure on the poster and caused the elimination to come undone therefore it is not their fault but it is the fault of the person who installed the posters. Their description says nothing about not being able to put this material in a frame in any way I have spoken to the rep who claims to be the manager and he basically told me that it was on me so I have to replace these posters for this customer out of my own pocket this is not the first time that I have had issues with a claim from this company they continually give problems if there's anything that puts them at fault for having to replace the material the ironic part is this particular customer has four more posters that he wants to get done but is not going to do them because they will not replace the existing posters I cannot recommend this company to anyone","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x80c2da6fbe9a996b:0xdefa758f030041b4","address":"B2Sign, Inc., 462 Humane Way, Pomona, CA 91766"}

Nowhere online does it state that I have to stay in my car, so my first impression is having an oversized security guard yelling for no reason. I found this slightly disrespectful, but more of an unorganized ordeal. The \"tender\" is more of a cashier that has to make multiple trips inside and out. First to verify your Id, then take your money, then finally they come back with your order. For a place titled \"express\" I've had faster service from other Haven locations downtown. Prices are the only decent thing I found satisfying.","pics":null,"resp":{"time":1612493032546,"text":"We apologize for the security raising his voice, that is something we don't tolerate, but we have had guests with issues hearing people through the masks.

This is a curbside location, so we do ask that you stay in your car due to the COVID laws to keep you and our employees safe.  You are more an welcome to place your order on site with your budtender, but if the order is already placed online, they must verify the ID before bringing any items out due to CA state laws.

I am doing gel manicure and polish pedicure for 10 years now. I go to many different places and have paid many different prices for various quality of services. They are very expensive for the service. This place doesn't even do basic scrubing on their In and Out package! It is ridicules! The staff was unfriendly and snubish, the Gel manicure is bumpy on almost every nail. She didn't wash or wipe my hands after filing, my hands still feel powdery now, I am sitting in the car and writing this! She didn't use alcohol after the last gel lighting. She said she doesn't need to, time will tell how true that was.\nAnyway, I am always fair on rating and always recommend services I like to others. But this place did a horrible job and I didn't like the arrogant attitude of the staff. Have had much better service for the same price,  including massages (arms and legs) and much nicer staff.\nI don't know what the other raters are talking about by wine offered and so on!

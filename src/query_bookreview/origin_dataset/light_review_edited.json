{"rating":4,"title":"A wonderful adventure in France","text":"I loved this book all the way until the end. I have recently discovered that the author is intending to release another book, and from what I understand it will continue where this one left off. I am thankful for this, as the way this book ended was definitely a negative for me. I wanted to know more! What happened to the author, did she learn what she came to learn? Did she get the job she was hoping for? So many questions.<br \/><br \/>From the beginning of Linda's book, it is easy to love her. She is open, honest and definitely has the type of personality you want your heroine to have, whether the book is fiction or reality. I couldn't help but root for Linda throughout her trials with her host family, even when I thought she acted as a bit of a brat herself. Listening to her internal thoughts about what she went through and her desire to achieve her goals made this book feel close to my heart.<br \/><br \/>I applaud the adventurous spirit of the author and her decision to keep journal entries from that chapter of her life. What great material to have later to inspire a book! While I enjoyed the entire memoir, my favourite part of this book would have to be the author's descriptions of the many places she visited and the people she met along the way. While I think she could definitely have made a better impression on the family she worked for if she had been honest about her lack of French language skills from the beginning, she is a pioneer. Her drive and desire to learn the language from those in the actual country was inspiring. Not many people would have been gutsy enough to do what Linda did.<br \/><br \/>I also particularly enjoyed the relationship between Linda and Antoine. The Kind heart of the author was apparent in her actions toward the children, even when she struggled with them.<br \/><br \/>There is some romance, and I appreciated the way the author handled it. While sex scenes are not necessarily automatically offensive, there is something about memoirs that makes me uncomfortable if they are filled with them. This author manages to hint at her experiences without going into too much detail, leaving the reader to decide exactly what happened. Great writing.<br \/><br \/>When you step into reading this book, you learn a lot about French customs, French cuisine and wine. You also get the opportunity to brush up on your French skills a bit and get to step outside yourself and live an adventure through the eyes of the author. I read this book in one sitting with very few breaks in between and found myself enthralled in the sights, sounds and atmosphere of this memoir.<br \/><br \/>In the end, I was disappointed that the book ended. I could have kept reading about Linda's experiences without stopping anytime in the foreseeable future. The end of the book leaves many unanswered questions, that I am assuming the author will be answering in her next book. Were this a standalone, I would be very disappointed with the way the book ended, but with the knowledge that she is writing another book to continue with her story, I can't fault this one. One thing is for sure, if you read this book, you will be anxiously awaiting the next.<br \/><br \/>I would recommend this to anyone who likes books about travel, memoirs or just a good story that came from the recollections and heart of the author. Read it, you will be glad you did. Overall, this was a VERY enjoyable read that gave me many reasons to wish I could drop everything and head off to France!","parent_asin":"1457514575","timestamp":1367776054000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":4,"title":"A Good read for Meat Eaters, and Veggie Heads as well","text":"We live in an area where most of our neighbors hunt. Although we've been here for 20 years, I would say that it's only been within the past five years that this former city girl has embraced the country lifestyle. That lifestyle includes hunting, something that I've almost lost some city friends over.<br \/><br \/>My feelings about hunting are as follows...although I myself eat very little meat, my dogs are my family, and what can I say, it's a family of carnivores! In addition, when you are aware of the dark side of those pretty plastic wrapped packages of meat in the supermarket, hunting seems pretty darn humane, and a reasonable way to procure meat for your family. I think of what the cows and chickens made into dog kibble went through, and what diseases they might have had before being in a can of cat food.<br \/><br \/>That being said, I'm always interested in different perspectives about hunting, lifestyles, and philosophies.<br \/><br \/>I enjoyed this book quite a bit because it contains all of the above. There seem to be so many books about hunting, magazines about hunting. Books on bow hunting, and dialogue about hunting a mule deer as opposed to a white tailed deer. I felt like this book fills a gap that had not been covered in any of the articles or books I had previously read.<br \/><br \/>Because I am passionate about knowing where my food comes from, and doing even a small part to make choices that are responsible, it was refreshing and affirming to read the author's perspective. When we grab a fast food hamburger, we don't think about the suffering animal that probably led an unnatural life, and we certainly don't think of the workers in the processing plants that do a job so brutal and often dangerous. This book reminds us to respect the food we eat, something that comes more naturally when you are closer to your food, closer to the animal that gives its life.","parent_asin":"0385529813","timestamp":1361405389000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":4,"title":"For anyone except avid non-hunters.","text":"This is a strange book.  It's basically a series of hunting short stories that also seek to explain why this guy likes hunting and why some people are so squeamish about it these days.  It's strange because - having grown up in rural America - I forget that some people (including men) don't like hunting, and I remember thinking to myself often throughout the book that most of the stories didn't seem all that different from what I could hear about from anyone I grew up with.  But now this guy is living in NYC, so I can imagine how he's now surrounded by people so far removed from his reality that they think he's a barbarian (similar to my Jersey-raised brother-in-law who once said to me in surprise, \"they let you have guns!?!?!\", as if he grew up under some communist regime rather than in the Land of the Free).<br \/><br \/>Despite all this, it seems as if he is writing mostly for other hunters.  And I want to be clear that he is a very talented writer and it was very easy to enjoy this book, even not being an active hunter myself.  He reminds me a little bit of myself in that he can write and explain his feelings eloquently, and yet if you don't like him without justification, he'll become self righteous quickly and give you more reasons to dislike him.  You'll see his writing have spots of crudeness at times, which allows you to see where he grew up.<br \/><br \/>None of these are meant to be negative.  I'm just trying - perhaps imperfectly - to point out why this is a strange book.  All the more reason to read it.","parent_asin":"0385529813","timestamp":1357487533000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":2,"title":"Heroine blames others for things & feels her bad behavior is justified","text":"\"Dead Silence\" is a Christian suspense novel. There was no romance. When Elsie realized that the FBI had no leads except for the ones that she gave them, she and her sister-in-law and a female reporter and a female lawyer worked together to find the clues and solve the case. Granted, they did get a little help from two men, but the women were the ones actively solving the case. The FBI were portrayed as hampered by having to follow protocol and sometimes as downright incompetent. This created some suspense as the bad guys could leave threatening messages with little fear of being caught.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, I didn't really like Elise. She tended to forget important things whenever her son was threatened, so it was easy to throw her off her game. When one of the FBI agents pointed out that the senator died because Elise forgot to warn her or the police about the plot, Elise kicked the agents out and refused to provide them with the information they requested that would help catch the bad guy who murdered her mother-in-law and was threatening her. She did show courage by continuing to investigate the case even when threatened. But when she and one of the FBI agents were talking in the house, something happened outside that they equally should have noticed but she publicly blamed the FBI for not seeing it. She promised to do certain things that would prevent a sympathetic FBI agent from getting in trouble for helping her, but then she didn't do them and made his life very difficult. She used her deep love for her son to justify her behavior, but one can love their child without also blaming everyone else for their own mistakes.<br \/><br \/>A major clue was dropped at the beginning, allowing the reader to know all along who the bad guy was. It was understandable that the main characters didn't immediately see the significance, but it still took them a frustratingly long time to make the connections. Elise was angry at God for allowing her son to be born deaf, his father and grandmother killed, etc. Her sister-in-law encouraged her to talk to God and trust him. There was no sex or bad language.<br \/><br \/>I received an ebook review copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley.","parent_asin":"1643523317","timestamp":1591022031979,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":4,"title":"Murder, Kidnapping, and Prayers","text":"There are so many things to love about \"Dead Silence,\" by Robin Caroll.  First and foremost, I absolutely adore the protagonist, Elise Carmichael,  and her 7 year-old son Sawyer.  Elise is a widow, whose husband was killed in military action.  Once an aspiring model, she serves as a courtroom interpreter and devotes herself to caring for her deaf and mute son.  Other major characters that Caroll endeared to me were Elise's sister-in-law, step father-in-law, babysitter,  and a rookie reporter.<br \/><br \/> I enjoy books that use a lot of character dialog to advance the plot.  It's even better when there is no foul language.  For readers who find comfort in religion in times of trouble, this book is for you.  Elise admits to being disappointed with, even mad at, God after losing her husband.  During a series of traumatic events, she struggles to find her way back to her faith.  Toward that end, she receives encouragement and counsel from her devout sister-in-law. Specific prayers and Bible verses are quoted. Blackmail, kidnapping, leaks from the FBI,  self-serving politicians, and a dramatic rescue attempt spice up the story.<br \/><br \/>The only reservations I have about \"Dead Silence\" are some incredibly delayed responses by Elise in the early parts of the action.  Although her son's accident certainly provides a plausible distraction, Elise literally ignores a death threat of which she had become aware.  Later, she puts off reviewing an email that was highly likely to contain clues about a murder.  She gets her act together by the middle of the book and becomes an active participant instead of a hapless bystander. Inasmuch as Elise's hesitations are important to the plot, and because she is so lovable, I am willing to overlook the almost unbelievable poor judgment on her part to recommend this book.","parent_asin":"1643523317","timestamp":1592160762966,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":4,"title":"Powerful and Compelling with a Couple Flaws - Thus Thoroughly Human!","text":"This is a powerful and compelling book. If nothing else, it presents a strong picture of what conversion (being born again) looks like. Whether someone was born and raised in a church or whether their background was like that of Mrs. Butterfield, the common foundation is that of overhaul and radical transformation. A person is simply not the same. With people raised in church, it may be a little more difficult to perceive, but it's still true. The Bible makes this clear in describing conversion as transferring someone from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of Jesus (Colossians 1:13).<br \/><br \/>The first half or so of this book is fascinating, as we get to see God working in His powerful but loving way on a heart. Truly, as Jesus said, no one comes to Him unless the Father draws them (John 6:44). What keeps this book from receiving 5 stars from me is the author's tangential foray into questionable doctrine. As a well-educated woman holding a doctorate, she no doubt enjoys defending her views, and she is skilled at doing so. I just believe she's well intentioned but wrong in her assessment of worship (and in a few other matters). It's just unfortunate that better editing did not remove this from the book. Admittedly, the book is already pretty brief, but her discussion and arguments for her views on worship add nothing to the book. Rather they detract. I am hopeful that in time, the author will discover the grace that frees Christians from such legalistic beliefs and practices. I love the Psalms and am edified by them and all scripture. But I am also edified by more modern songs (or poetry) that I would call the equivalent of &#34;modern psalms.&#34; People today can still write music by the Spirit of God, which is to be used for the edification of the saints. Scripture speaks of this (1 Cor. 14:26). The same Holy Spirit that inspired David and the other writers of Psalms still writes music through people today, and while I doubt the influence of the Holy Spirit in most of the modern Christian music in production today, that does not negate its operation in the few.<br \/><br \/>There are a couple parts of this book that should not be missed. As I mentioned, the first section (half or so), describing the author's journey to salvation, is fantastic. It is raw and real - just what a testimony should be. There is another section much later in the book, when the author gets married, that presents the pastor's words that were given at the wedding. The 8 pages or so on marriage and its meaning and typology is excellent, very edifying. I highly recommend those pages alone, if that's all you read.<br \/><br \/>Apparently their worship style is very conservative, practically Orthodox. I'm not sure what instruments they use, but I know they don't use electric guitars and stuff like that. I doubt they use drums, etc. They also, for singing, only use the words of the Psalms. That's it; that's all that's allowed. While (as you surely know) I am a huge fan of songs that have put scripture to music, I simply can't go down that legalistic road of saying that's all we should do. She makes some strong arguments for it, and I would expect nothing less from a woman as educated as she; but I still heartily disagree with her. I just think she may be (or was?) a little too young in the Lord, and also likely lacking in understanding the freedom we have in the Holy Spirit, to discern this issue rightly. Sadly, because of her strong scholarship and writing skills, she will probably lead others astray in this area. I'm hoping the rest of the book will get back to things that I find more edifying, but I just thought I'd let you know about this.","parent_asin":"1884527388","timestamp":1486575843000,"helpful_vote":38,"verified_purchase":true}
{"rating":5,"title":"Winning in Fatherhood","text":"All Pro Dad is written in the outline and style of a football playbook. Mark Merrill described the fundamentals of fatherhood as loving our children no matter what mistakes and failures they might make in their lifetime. Leading and discipline our children can be extremely difficult but it has to be done in order to teach them the accurate way to conduct their lives.<br \/><br \/>The book shared seven essentials to becoming a better father that your wife and children need you to be. Some of the seven are Makeup, Mind-set, Model, and Message. Merrill believed fathers had to know who they are in their identity. We aren't what others have claimed and declared us to be. Most men try to define themselves with what job positions they hold, what kind of car they drive, and many other fault assets. But our true identity is the unique person God has made us to be. It's also important to know what our true gifts and purpose are. Without understanding that lies spoken over us aren't true and they don't make our identity, we can't teach our children who they are called to be. Speaking and telling our kids to believe what God has already declared about them is a significant step to instilling the truth into their lives.<br \/><br \/>I enjoyed the stories about parenting and life lessons that Mark Merrill included from Tony Dungy, S. Truett Cathy, Michael W. Smith, Michael Ducker, James \"JB\" Brown, Norm Miller, and others. Readers will also benefit from huddling up and asking the questions at the end of each chapter to their children.<br \/><br \/>I would recommend this life changing book to any father who wants to lead their children in an effective way. The book is written for dads but if you're planning or possibly think you might become a father one day then read this remarkable book. I am not a father yet but this book still benefited me in learning the skills and the tools to become a better father. The seven critical steps will change how you parent your children and it will radically change how you view yourself. I learned the importance of believing what God has made me to be and called me to be. I must build up my children by revealing to them how proud I am of them, how I love them, and pointing out their gifts that I notice them portraying. Our words can inspire our children or they can lead them astray, trying to earn approval elsewhere. If we don't give them attention and love they will seek and try to fill the void somewhere else. The book showed me that it's my job to teach my children about faith, manners, sports, character traits, and sex education. We can't become passive and expect the pastor to teach our kids about faith and God, the school to educate them about manners, peer pressure, drugs, and sex, and practicing sports. Great parenting has to start in the home and it has to be practiced and displayed daily. This book will guide fathers into leading their families towards their God ordained potentials in life that will last for generations!<br \/><br \/>\"I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com book review bloggers program.\"","parent_asin":"1595555072","timestamp":1340643174000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":4,"title":"an important read","text":"Rosaria Butterfield has an important story, and it's one that by and large gets silenced. It's not PC. It's potentially offensive. Yet it tells of the grace and power of the gospel. How else could one explain a lesbian professor of queer studies who gets found by Jesus and converts? There are those readers who will assume that she has been brainwashed or worse. I found her insight on sexuality and the church stunningly accurate. (&#34;Sexuality is more a symptom of our life's condition than a cause, more of a consequence than an origin.&#34;) She has the maturity, intelligence, and authority to comment on the LGBT culture as well as the church's response to it. The combination of her deep conversion as well as her love for the English language makes for good reading. While I don't necessarily agree with all of her conclusions (not using instruments for worship), I do respect her thoughtful and careful research into her life choices.","parent_asin":"1884527388","timestamp":1401293404000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":3,"title":"RICK \"SHAQ\" GOLDSTEIN SAYS: \"THESE THINGS WE DO THAT OTHERS MAY LIVE.\"","text":"As a proud Honorably Discharged Viet Nam Era Veteran I have made it part of my adult life to read as many true war books as I can. On many... I get emotionally intertwined in the stories in many ways. Some of it is unabashed pride... some is bone shaking sorrow... some is gallows humor that only someone who had been there could understand... and much of it is anger at the way I and my compatriots were treated not only by the enemy... but by our own American citizens back home. The ever increasing *RULES OF ENGAGEMENT* that only the United States takes to such non-sensical extremes...  are constantly growing and it's akin to putting shackles on our brave soldiers when our lives are on the line. And in recent years it is utterly fascinating to me how the use of the \"players\" on the battlefield have changed... and how the battlefield itself has changed in many ways... and yet in many ways its stayed the same.<br \/><br \/>Author Marcus Luttrell does a fine job in this book in many areas such as describing the irritating and expanding Rules Of Engagement... but unfortunately the writing in this book drags for long periods of time. It surely doesn't measure up to his earlier fast-paced *LONE SURVIVOR*. The author's pride in America and limitless dedication and love for our country... and the hero after hero... that our Lord has blessed our country with... portrayed in this solid story... is never at issue. It's simply  that the story is told in fits of peaks and extended valleys. With my personal experience and lust for literary growth in the human side of modern warfare... it's almost ridiculous how many books on this subject are constantly being published... almost  like water through a burst dam.  Unfortunately the percentage  of these books that make a major literary impact like the aforementioned *LONE SURVIVOR* are less and less on a percentage basis.<br \/><br \/>There are some great quotes and analogies that really hit home to people that know... such as:<br \/><br \/>\"ERNEST HEMINGWAY ONCE WROTE THAT \"THERE IS NO HUNTING LIKE THE HUNTING OF MAN AND THOSE WHO HAVE HUNTED ARMED MEN LONG ENOUGH AND LIKED IT, NEVER REALLY CARE FOR ANYTHING ELSE THEREAFTER.\" \"LET ME FLIP THAT AROUND: THERE IS, IN FACT, NO FEAR AS DEEP AS THE FEAR OF BEING HUNTED. THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE THIS FEAR FIND, LATE IN LIFE, THAT THEY NEVER HAVE REASON TO BE AFRAID OF ANYTHING ELSE.\"<br \/><br \/>Then there is the term: \"MOGADISHU MILE\"... \"TO REACH THEIR TEAMMATES, THEY WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A TWO-HUNDRED-YARD DASH THROUGH HELL.\"<br \/><br \/>The difference between being afraid and fear... is clearly defined: \"FEAR IS A FORCE THAT SHARPENS YOUR SENSES. BEING AFRAID IS A STATE OF PARALYSIS IN WHICH YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING.\" And as any veteran knows all too well... the latter of these two \"states\" is what gets your teammates killed. As you can see there are some great true life gems in this book... but they're just way too far in between at times. On  a very personal note... the best friend I had in my life was my deceased Dad... and one thing he always preached to me \"IS THAT IF YOU CAN COUNT YOUR REAL FRIENDS ON ONE HAND YOU'RE TRULY A RICH MAN!...AND FAIR-WEATHER FRIENDS ARE A DIME A DOZEN... WHEN YOU'RE REALLY DOWN YOU'LL SEE WHO YOUR REAL FRIENDS ARE BECAUSE THEY'LL STICK WITH YOU!\" Marcus echoes my Dad's mantra as follows: \"IF YOU REALLY WANT TO  KNOW IF SOMEONE IS A TRUE FRIEND, GET YOURSELF INTO A TIGHT SPOT WITH HIM OR HER; EVERYONE HAS PLENTY OF FRIENDS WHEN THINGS ARE GOOD, BUT TRUE FRIENDSHIP IS FORGED IN MOMENTS OF CHAOS. IT'S A SAD FACT, BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.\"<br \/><br \/>There's a  lot of heartfelt \"meat\" in this book... but unfortunately it's surrounded by a lot of \"fat\" that could have been cut.","parent_asin":"0316185361","timestamp":1338231747000,"helpful_vote":9,"verified_purchase":true}

{"rating":5,"title":"There Are Hunters Here Within Us","text":"I am amazed at the bare faced honesty Steven Rinella provides as he discusses various hunting expeditions throughout his life.  Not everything was legal, but for the most part it is obvious that the author is a man with deep moral values.  The only thing I found disturbing in his candid stories was when he admitted to killing feral house cats for bait.  Feral or no, killing feral house cats is not something I can stomach.  For the record he calls them feral house cats - emphasis on house.<br \/><br \/>From fur trapping, fishing, bear hunting, lions & more Meat Eater leaves no adventure untouched.  Experiencing cold, hunger, loneliness, fear & tears of joy at the humbling site of a snow capped mountain. From learning to hunt from his father & brothers.  Regrets he made to amazing adventures in remote places, Steven will keep you reading until the very end.<br \/><br \/>Sprinkled throughout you will find little recipes & tidbits about cooking various animals & parts of animals including beaver tail. Steven discusses catching wild Alaskan salmon & eating them fresh.  He compares the difference between what most of us eat vs. what it really tastes like.  It is enough to drive you mad with longing for truly fresh wild salmon especially knowing you may never get to know what it really tastes like.<br \/><br \/>Reading his stories made me pine even more for a bygone era when we knew where our food came from be this blood & guts or dirt & roots.  In today's age of grocery stores & pretty packaging what is on store shelves is hardly recognizable as food anymore.  Unless you are in the produce section!<br \/><br \/>You don't have to be a hunter to appreciate Meat Eater.  Which ever \"side\" you are on; hunting or not, I think you will find Steven's book a worthy read.","parent_asin":"0385529813","timestamp":1360030548000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":3,"title":"It was alright.","text":"This was my first “Matsumoto” book- it was good, for the most part. The story is fairly slow moving, but I didn’t find it dull. It’s not action packed, but more so plodding. I felt it took the pace of an actual investigation, not like the usual stuff on tv shows, which is solved quickly. This case takes places over months and you’re along for the ride at every detour, red herring, and misleading clue. Because, you know, that’s realistic.<br \/><br \/>My issues were two-fold. First, the actual murder method, which made me go, “Really? That’s the avenue we’re going?” I didn’t care for it- it seemed ridiculous to me. I was all about this mystery until then. Then, it was “meh.”<br \/><br \/>Second, as others have pointed out, is formatting (I got the Kindle Book). I got through it, but my goodness. It’s a hot mess in places. Words were jumbled “togetherwithoutspaces” which was annoying. Another issue is that incorrect letters were used. For example,  “Imanishi-san” would be something ridiculous, like “Imanishi-sfhh.” Huh? Yeah, you’d think someone would have proofread. On the same note, if you had an “ri” in a word, such as ”riot,” the letters merged and became “not.” I guess an “ri” looks like an “n.” It was frustrating at times to figure out what exactly I was reading. It’s not like it was all over the place, but at least several times in a chapter.<br \/><br \/>So, the story is itself was decent- nothing fantastic, but fun. But don’t bother reading If you’re getting the ebook, unless you want to be a detective yourself, trying to figure out what you’re looking at.","parent_asin":"B003P2WETK","timestamp":1564426674554,"helpful_vote":17,"verified_purchase":true}

Starting into electronics via the various internet sites has been excruciatingly difficult and slow. Picked this book up and wham, I'm off to the races. This book is for anyone interested in getting into electronics who has a minimum of basic math (addition division etc) and science knowledge. Experiential education (hands on) is the best way for 99 percent of us to learn, and that is what this book is all about.<br \/><br \/>Plan on spending at least another $100 on parts, perhaps more if you want some quality tools. (A decent used Fluke Multimeter can fetch $150-$200, whereas the book suggests a cheap $2. is fine for instance).  Currently picking up parts off Chinese sites is cheap as there is no postage for cheap Chinese parts the US taxpayer pays the postage currently, the current administration thinks thats not right and is dead set on changing it.

It's tricky, though, because it basically takes place about 80 years after a worse-than-covid (I hope) pandemic has wiped out huge populations and everyone else has retreated into completely sealed apartments.  So it's a dystopian future thing but wow, it's remarkably realistic.  The author's note at the back says that he drafted it two years before covid and finished it during lockdown.<br \/><br \/>My kids and I agreed it was slow to get started.  There's a lot of world-building that takes the first third of the book, and there are a few big steps our heroine, Cleo, has to take.  The time from the first big step to the second is long... many chapters of moving through the apartment building (which is huge, like a city, but still).  It got really good once Cleo achieved the second big step, and the ending was satisfying to my kids but not entirely.  They wanted more change, more innovation, more of a different future.  Also, there's a twist that my kids saw coming a hundred pages away.<br \/><br \/>Overall, though, an interesting way to do a dystopian future story with the middle grade set who may not have encountered much of that before.

{"rating":5,"title":"The best book for budding electronics hobbyists","text":"This is the book that taught me electronics and ignited my passion for a new hobby. It is a very easy read and teaches everything through hands-on exercises. I would recommend this book without hesitation both to an adult wanting to learn fundamental electronics as well as for any parents who want their kids to learn electronics.  It covers the fundamentals with just the right amount of theory and offers lots of practical advice for a beginner on things like soldering and setting up an electronics workshop. The projects that this book will have you build are a lot of fun and at the end of the book I found myself wishing there were more projects like these I could do (luckily now there are, in Make: More Electronics, by the same author). The kits available from Makershed to go along with this book are also a godsend because trying to order all the electronic components needed by this book from an electronic supplier like Mouser can be very intimidating for a beginner.<br \/><br \/>I had a few nits to pick with the first edition of this book: namely the use of TTL (7400LS) logic chips, which I found very finicky, and regardless are not much used anymore.  Fortunately, the author has taken reader feedback seriously and addressed my complaint and those of other readers in the second edition. Another change I agree with is the switch in focus from Basic Stamp and Picaxe to Arduino in the section on microcontrollers. Arduino has revolutionized the hobbyist microcontroller landscape and has taken the maker world by storm to the extent that it is now the de facto standard for anyone getting started with microcontrollers. Finally, I found the fact that the author explicitly mentions the feedback from his readers and integrates the lessons learned from the the first edition into his text very refreshing.  The fact that he has acknowledged that making good electronic circuits is a process, even for someone experienced as him, makes this book all the more accessible and educational.","parent_asin":"1680450263","timestamp":1454987474000,"helpful_vote":9,"verified_purchase":true}

He takes you into his secret world blow by blow and takes you right into battle with him and his friends. These are Great Men doing Great deeds, 99% of it we will never learn about. Luttrell does a great job at keeping politics out of his story. If you read Mr. Luttrell's first book \"Lone Survivor\" you know what kind of hell he went through in Afghanistan. Luttrell rehabbed himself back into warrior fighting condition and did a final tour of duty in Iraq. Luttrell definition of service is much different than most people. His definition of service is giving Everything he had both physically and mentally. Luttrell and men like him on the teams go WAY above and beyond what the average man call patriotism. These men are True Hero Warriors. A must read for young and old alike. 5 Stars!!!!","parent_asin":"0316185361","timestamp":1370606802000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true}

{"rating":5,"title":"Always a Lady But a Slave In Private","text":"This 3rd part of the series really gets intense. It's like it is a 3 way but it is not. Tabby feelings are for the dark queen and she states them clearly to Rowan when he asks her about their relationship which she pretty much tells him she is her to do whatever she pleases. When she is with the queen she is her slave in private again. In public, she is her consort to give orders to others, but also to be punished if she doesn't follow orders as she should. This story really gets into Rowan character why he is in the hands of the queen and tabby. Rowan is a slave and is put to work as a slave, and wow, talk about all the kink he goes through.<br \/>I would of like to of like to know a bit more of Rowan than she gave, but he wasn't the main person in the story but I am happy how she wrote it. Rowan father is a charmer, huh, NOT... Anyways. I don't like to give too much away. I really enjoyed reading this book it gave so much more insight to the Dark Queen, Tabby, and Rowan. I am sure we are not done with them yet. One more book to go... can't wait for that one. Already getting me excited about what to come. Love it.

{"rating":5,"title":"A Unique Calling","text":"I have to be honest, I didn't know that there was so much attention being given to this book before I read it.  But, after I finished, I went looking around.  I started with Amazon and the reviews posted for the book.  There were over 340 reviews with only 5 under 3 stars. That's actually far better than I expected it to be.  There is a particular issue that the Ms. Butterfield touches on that I knew could really incite people to comment negatively on her book--whether they'd read it or not.  One of the reviews was actually misrated, so I considered there only to be 4 real, negative reviews.  The negative reviews, though, didn't surprise me.<br \/><br \/>Ms. Butterfield's book is the story of how she came to believe in Christ and the story of her reformed faith.  Her story begins when she was a tenured English professor at Syracuse University in New York.  She was a lesbian women's studies professor.  This book is her story--her testimony.  I began reading the book knowing these basic facts about her.  I was curious to see how she would address homosexuality and Christianity.<br \/><br \/>In her interview with Family Life Today, she explains that she doesn't see her homosexuality as the crux of her conversion.  But, I understand why many people are reading it simply because she addresses this issue.  She addresses many more issues of faith than homosexuality, though.  She tells the story of how it was the relationships she had with people that God used to bring her to Him.  She shares her thoughts about faith, life, and church.  I don't want to share too many details about what she writes, because it was how her book unfolded for me that drew me in.<br \/><br \/>She tells her story well.  She was an English professor.  Her book is very well organized, thought out, and clearly conveyed.  There are lots of big, descriptive words--in all the right places.  What I mean is that the reading level of this book is appropriate for a high school or college student, rather than a middle school student.  In reading so many books over the past few years, I've noticed that many authors use simple sentence structures and common descriptive words to convey their ideas.  Ms. Butterfield stays true to her literature professor roots and writes as one would expect of her.<br \/><br \/>Before I finish this review, I want to address the four negative reviews on Amazon.  They were all written by individuals that had been given this book by well meaning Christians.  The intention and hope behind these gifts (I presume) was that this book would open the eyes of the receivers to Christ's love for them.  But, the giving of this book to someone who is homosexual is the opposite of the example that this author's story is for believers.  Ms. Butterfield's testimony is about the relationships in her life and how they shaped her and her faith.  It is about how God used people in her life--not to preach at her, but to first listen to her with respect, and then discuss faith with her when she was ready.  No one handed her a gospel tract or the four spiritual laws.  A local pastor asked her a question and invited her over to dinner at his home.  He built relationships with her and the people in her life.<br \/><br \/>One of the questions that students consider when analyzing literature is who the intended audience of a book is and what is the author's purpose.  I believe the author's intended audience is other Christians and that her purpose is to inform.  I don't believe the author's purpose is to persuade.  She is very strong in her opinions and states clearly why she believes what she does.  But, these are her convictions.  For example, I can imagine that some readers may feel put off by her exposition about why she feels only psalms should be sung in church.  This is a worship practice specific to the RPCNA, the denomination of which she is a member.  I see this book as Rosaria Butterfield's memoir, testimony, and philosophy about life all rolled into one.  We each could give one.  We all have our own convictions, too.  We are not identical to one another.  It's even scriptural.  I am okay knowing that she feels strong convictions about foster care and adoption.  I am okay that she feels strongly about psalm singing.  I am okay that she has certain convictions about the way the world works that I don't share with her.  When I read this book, I felt like I was getting to know someone--learning who she is, what has shaped her, and how God is working in her life.  This book isn't meant to be a Christian &#34;How to&#34; about anything.  It's a testimony, a collection of thoughts, written with the desire to give the reader something to chew on.<br \/><br \/>Would I recommend this book?  Yes.  Unequivocally yes.  I hope you will enjoy it.  I'd love to discuss it with you if you read it!<br \/><br \/>Please note that I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher Crown and Covenant Publications.","parent_asin":"1884527388","timestamp":1382240198000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":5,"title":"Great gothic fiction from the first wave of gothic writing","text":"The book has some really well written gothic fiction.  I am always pleasantly surprised with these anthologies as they bring back works that have been largely forgotten by the reading public, and which deserve new attention.  I expected gentille stories akin to Edith Wharton's ghost stories, but these tales are more shocking and many of them will flay your sensibilities.  They contain curses, murder, infanticide, and other crimes.  In one story, a newborn baby is squashed under his own grandfather's boot.  Like the very best writers of gothic horror, masters like Shirley Jackson and Edgar Allan Poe, the writers of the literary age represented in this book were keenly aware that the greatest and most effective horror is human evil.<br \/><br \/>The Vampyre, by John Polidori:  An aristocratic vampire takes advantage and destroys young women of noble lineage.  The story introduces the aristocratic vampire to the English readership for the first time.<br \/><br \/>Sir Guy Eveling's Dream, by Horace Smith:  The classic ghost story of a young man who falls for a ghost woman.<br \/><br \/>Confessions of a Reformed Ribbonman, by William Carleton: A story of a terrible revenge in which innocent men are forced to bear witness.  An entire family is murdered, including the little babes, because the father reported a house robber to the police.  The robber is sent to prison, and the robber's family decides to avenge him by burning the house down with the family inside, and killing anyone who attempts to escape.<br \/><br \/>Monos and Daimonos, by Edward Bulwer:  A murderer is pursued by the phantom of his victim, which never leaves him alone for a second.<br \/><br \/>The Master of Logan, by Allan Cunningham:  The defilement of a grave and its contents leads to the ghost persecuting the master of an aristocratic house, and a showdown between the forces of good and evil.<br \/><br \/>The Victim, by Anonymous:  A story relating to the murders committed by Burke and Hare, who murdered innocent people in order to provide cadavers to medical students as anatomy subjects.<br \/><br \/>Some Terrible Letters from Scotland, by James Hogg:  Unrelated letters containing frightening accounts about the cholera epidemic in Scotland.<br \/><br \/>The Curse, by Anonymous:  An old curse impels the scion of a great house to murderous actions, ruining himself and his noble family.<br \/><br \/>Life in Death, by Anonymous:  A scientist discovers a way to come back from death which depends on someone rubbing his corpse with a life-restoring balm.  But the horror occasioned by the task makes it impossible to perform.<br \/><br \/>My Hobby--rather, by NP Willis:  A young medical student is asked to hold an overnight vigil over a corpse, and in the process of doing so discovers the corpse being eaten by a cat.<br \/><br \/>The Red Man, by Catherine Gore:  Impressive story combining a travelogue style with gothic elements.  The author utilizes France and it's then recent past of the French revolution as a setting for a truly horrifying tale that includes murder and infanticide.<br \/><br \/>Post-mortem Recollections of a Medical Lecturer, by Charles Lever:  A professor dies and comes back from death being able to describe the process of what happened.<br \/><br \/>The Bride of Lindorf, by Letitia E. Landon:  A tale full of classic gothic elements (old castles, damsels in distress that turn out to be villains, madness, and murder).  It is similar to stories by Anne Radcliffe, though not quite as good as Radcliffe.<br \/><br \/>Passage in the Secret History of an Irish Countess, by J.S. Le Fanu:  After the death of her father, a young and innocent heiress is placed in the care of her uncle, a man whose reputation has been tarnished by the suspicion of murder.<br \/><br \/>This anthology has something for everyone, and especially for students of literature.","parent_asin":"019955241X","timestamp":1250027899000,"helpful_vote":8,"verified_purchase":true}

{"rating":4,"title":"Great for Dads - and Moms too!","text":"\"All-Pro Dad,\" by Mark Merrill, is an instructional book about being a good father.  But it also contains the guidance to be a good person, husband, citizen, etc., etc.<br \/>Being a good father doesn't mean providing the means for the family to live well - providing a roof over their heads and food on the table.  It goes way beyond that.  This book shows how giving of yourself is so much more important.  And it's difficult but can certainly be accomplished by anyone.<br \/>Mark Merrill provides seven steps to accomplishing this feat.  You need to know yourself, determine your purpose, motive, method, know you're a model to your children, know your message and your master - for what you are living.<br \/>The book is full of personal stories, which make reading it so much more interesting than a book that's simply instructional.  It's organized in a step-by-step fashion and suggests questions you can ask yourself.  But, interestingly, it's never preachy.","parent_asin":"1595555072","timestamp":1337805320000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

A monumental task, considering all injections are done &#34;blind.&#34;<br \/><br \/>The book includes background information about the concept of pain, pharmacology, psychology of pain and head and neck anatomy. Of all the books I have on Dental Anaesthesia, this one remains my favorite and most used reference source. The full color illustrations, often several on all but a few of the 200 pages, by Poul Buckhoj depict the target area showing the muscles, bone, nerves, and blood vessels of all the dental injections except the Akinosi-Vazirani mandibular block.<br \/><br \/>The accompanying text is clear, concise, and nothing is lost in the translation. If you want the best illustrated text for use in leaning dental anaesthesia, this work by Evers and Haegerstam, et. al., is what you should have on the top of your shopping list. It is very sad this book is no longer in print.  In this review I have added a few pages of the hardback book I still have.<br \/><br \/>As a footnote: there is an Amazon listing where it appears I have posted my original review of the Evers and Haegerstam book which has been totally corrupted by Amazon and will most likely see you purchasing a book you don't even want.

{"rating":4,"title":"Mixed bag, mostly good","text":"There is much to like about this book.  Almost from the beginning, you are encouraged to do things yourself, and the experiments can be a lot of fun.  There are cogent and useful explanations of things like the various kinds of mechanical switches, SPST, DPDT, etc., that can be pretty confusing the first time you encounter them.  Even though intuitively you already know what all of them are.<br \/><br \/>On the other hand, this book introduces some topics and accompanies them with some hand-waving that will probably leave you frustrated if you don't already understand them.  One circuit introduced is an oscillator, using two transistors and two capacitors.  I can see that it works, I can follow the explanation, but it's vague.  Exactly how the period of the oscillations is controlled is not explained.  We're just told, &#34;voltage rises faster here than here.&#34;  I'm sure that's true.  It's not leading me to the deep understanding I want.  So I will need to go elsewhere for that.  I know there is more to it than merely &#34;voltage rising&#34; across two resistors; the weird nature of the capacitors is involved.  We're also told that the voltage across the capacitor is at one point pulled below zero, but again, I don't have any understanding of what is really going on.<br \/><br \/>I have also been a little frustrated that some things need to be dumbed down a bit more than I would hope is necessary.  For instance, a dire warning is made not to buy a P2N2222 transistor.  Its pinouts are collector-base-emitter, instead of the usual emitter-base-collector.  I get the feeling that the author at one time thought, big deal, so just pay attention a little, but then had to deal with many readers complaining that their circuits wouldn't work, and it's because they wouldn't pay attention a little.  (Like, just rotate the transistor half a turn and there, now you have emitter-base-collector.)  So parts of the book are devoted to handholding like this instead of more interesting topics.<br \/><br \/>Nevertheless, I have learned things, and I have had fun.  I now understand using transistors as high-speed switches, and that was a big step up for me.","parent_asin":"1680450263","timestamp":1467835725000,"helpful_vote":7,"verified_purchase":true}

Rinella most definitely knows where HIS food comes from, and I admire that. I believe the current way most of us get meat in our society is pretty screwed up, and not good for either us or the feedlot animals we consume. I started raising chickens this year (for eggs, primarily, though I did raise, butcher, and consume one meat bird). I don't eat a lot of meat, and it's not a good idea for society as a whole to consume more animals than plant products (eating higher on the food chain isn't at all ecologically efficient), but it's tough to get all requisite protein from plants, and most of us just don't want to. And there is certainly land where crops won't grow, but wild animals flourish, making hunting for game a reasonable way to provide for human needs. Certainly better than pumping confined cattle full of steroids and antibiotics just to keep them marginally healthy.<br \/><br \/>Rinella's book was an excellent read. It opens the door to the perspective of at least one hunter, though I know hunters come in all varieties, and I would support the motives of some far more than others. I still don't support killing for sport, or the aquisition of trophies, and the drive for some hunters to pursue threatened and endangered species (that they have no intention of eating!) just drives me insane. I support the 2nd Amendment (and own a gun myself), but I despise the NRA's political machinations.<br \/><br \/>Not sure why I'm rambling. Hunting is an important subject, and I believe it can be pursued ethically. As a way of providing for a family's nutritional needs, well... I can support that, and Rinella shows how it can be done in this fascinating account of his adventures.","parent_asin":"0385529813","timestamp":1355248752000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":3,"title":"Can't put it down, to muddling through it, to Can't pick it up to finish.","text":"Rosaria's story is very compelling. First chapter was extremely interesting as it describes her head on collision with God. However, as the story continues, I found it a growing struggle to get through each succeeding chapter. They are relatively long chapters (for a small book), so it makes it hard to find a place to regroup and try again later. Now I just can't get motivated to read the last chapter. My take for what it's worth, is that she's presenting a Reformed doctrinal bias, rather than giving credit to simple Christian truths that transcend the differences sects may have. Because this book is testomonial in nature, bringing such strong emphasis on her denomination takes away from her story. Her conversion was glorious. And although she tries real hard to not sound like she lumps Christians into generalities, she does just the opposite. She is very comfortable with bashing stereotypes, but fails to get the idea across that those who create stereotypes are usually on the fringe of any group (i.e. homophobes). You get the feeling that there are very few really good Christians out there, and she was lucky enough to find these rare creatures in a particular denomination. I highly recommend the first chapter, and would even say its worth buying the book for.","parent_asin":"1884527388","timestamp":1382808577000,"helpful_vote":14,"verified_purchase":true}

{"rating":5,"title":"Great \"game plan\" for parenting","text":"All Pro Dad is a dad's \"game plan\" for parenting.<br \/><br \/>The first chapter is titled Fatherhood Fundamentals. The two fundamentals to fatherhood are love and leadership. Both are defined and explained, and the connection between love and leadership is explained. Then the 7 Ms are introduced. The 7 Ms are Makeup (who am I?), Mindset (what's my purpose?), Motive (why do I do what I do?), Method (how can I better love my family?), Model (what should I model to my children?), Message (what do I need to share with others?), and Master (who or what am I living for?).<br \/><br \/>Each of the 7 Ms has its own chapter. In the chapter on Makeup we learn about the difference between your image and your identity, and how to validate your child's identity and your spouse's identity. We also learn about your gifts, and how to validate the gifts your children and spouse have. In the chapter on Mindset, we learn about internal and external influences on your way of thinking, and also how to change to a new way of thinking. This chapter addresses your mission, your goals, and your job description: CEO of the Family. There are ten essentials listed: love your wife, spend time with your kids, be a role model, understand and enjoy your children, show affection, secure your family's financial future, eat together as a family, discipline with a gentle spirit, pray and worship together, and realize you're a father forever. There are also \"Four Cs for the CEO\" which are Communication, Calendar, Chores and Checkbook.<br \/><br \/>Next we come to Motive. Fatherhood will not be effective if it is fueled by selfish motives. The author instructs you not to follow your heart but to lead your heart, and offers three phases of growth from selfish to selfless motives. Finally you are challenged to check your motives. After this is a chapter on your Method for loving your family. This chapter contains truth about your marriage and loving your wife, as well as ideas for showing love to your children and building \"monuments\" of memories with them.<br \/><br \/>Chapter six is on being a Model to your children. This chapter covers the concept of consistency and understanding the principle of sowing and reaping. A \"Flight Plan\" is given, which compares fatherhood to being a pilot in several different ways, and there is a list of 7 truths about marriage and 12 truths about parenting. The next chapter is on your Message. This chapter talks about the pain in your life and how you can turn it into a message for others. This chapter also talks about creating your message from the passions in your life. Several examples of others' messages are given, and then some suggestions to help you realize your message to share and also helping your child realize their message.<br \/><br \/>Chapter eight is on knowing your Master, the driving force behind your decisions, and on changing your master if you have the wrong focus. The author gives several reasons to believe in a creator, and to place God as the master in your life.<br \/><br \/>After this is the conclusion of the book, which encourages fathers to keep striving to do better.<br \/><br \/>My opinion of this book is that it's great. I love the message to fathers and I think children greatly benefit by having a devoted dad who reads this kind of book. As a mom I learned a few things I can do better as well (most parenting advice to fathers can apply to mothers, and most parenting advice to mothers can also apply to fathers) and also got a better vision in my head of the kind of man I would like in mine and my children's lives. This was a great book on love and leadership, and I was glad to see the focus on being a good husband to be a better dad.<br \/><br \/>I received a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.","parent_asin":"1595555072","timestamp":1345517761000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":5,"title":"Gripping, well-paced fantasy adventure with compelling characters and a unique magic system.","text":"The Islevale Cycle by D.B. Jackson delivers a gripping, well-paced fantasy adventure with compelling characters and a unique magic system.<br \/><br \/>Time's Children (book one) hooked me with its drastic magic costs, the inclusion of small children, and demons that are truly \"other.\" D. B. Jackson takes time travel to the next level by exacting daunting costs for those who Walk through time, giving his magic system a unique feel, and keeping his human characters grounded, relatable in their struggle to outwit high odds with limited resources.<br \/><br \/>And did I mention that there's a baby? Children are naturally left out of most adventure fantasy because they're fragile and can't stick it to the antagonist. With Islevale's themes of maturity, love, and family, including a child works excellently. In book two, Time's Demon, time demon Droë brings her own layer of complexity to these themes with her child-like appearance and her almost-love fascination with human Walker Tobias, who is actually 15 but now appears older and finds himself taking care of a baby.<br \/><br \/>In following these themes, the Islevale Cycle includes NSFW scenes of nakedness, and scenes portraying sex, without delving into explicit erotica. Genre-wise, characters become couples or wish to become so, but the series starts with a heavy dose of adventure that drives the plot apart from romance. Sex and violence are all handled well and definitely not just for shock value. It's an adult-audience series with complex, adult views on humanity and love.<br \/><br \/>Speaking of Droë, I don't want to spoil too much, so let's just say that the demons in the Islevale Cycle give off a spine-shivering sense of \"other,\" as one tends to do when one's sustenance is literally the years stolen from human lives. And while time demons appear humanoid, one demon type is literally a mist cloud and figures wonderfully into sailor's lore. And, of course, where there are pirates, there are also beautiful, enigmatic sea demons. Readers who enjoy fae in fiction but crave something new will love D.B. Jackson's unique demon classes.<br \/>Also, there are pirates! D. B. Jackson shows a wide range of lifestyles as his characters cross vast distances in a complex world, with a mind for how age and gender effects experiences. We start in a school for young mages but soon visit castles, pirate ships, port towns, and seaside slums, and all the nooks and crannies of human existence that those imply. There's also a bit of political intrigue, as politics underpin why Tobias Walks back in time in the first place, and how he ends up with a baby. I prefer character-driven stories, so I was pleased with how all the politics and cool magic feeds directly into character motivations.<br \/><br \/>This might sound a little strange, but I love how nice and considerate the characters are to each other. (Uh, to their friends. You know. The ones they're not murdering or getting murdered by?) The dialogue feels real and I quite enjoy the considerate attitude of POV characters for their loved ones. There are high stakes a-plenty, but characters also talk to each other like you would hope a friend would talk to you if your lives were in danger. This not only contrasts well with the demons, who are a step removed from human emotion and the workings of human relationships, but also provides depth for conflict between the antagonists and the protagonists. Without sacrificing a sense of right and wrong, D. B. Jackson shows how characters like Droë set on their paths, how they, too, fight from a sense of something good to pursue or protect.<br \/><br \/>Pick up the D. B. Jackson's Islevale Cycle and let Tobias and Droë take you on an epic fantasy adventure full of time travel, demons, and the harried pursuit of life, liberty, and love:","parent_asin":"B07GD54Z2J","timestamp":1622477980072,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":5,"title":"Hysterically funny","text":"Based on user reviews and the cover, I decided to buy this book. I did not realize that it would be about the size of my palm. So, I was a bit disappointed that this was such a thin volume. However, despite its size, it requires both hands to keep the book open comfortably, which may seem like an odd comment, but once you are holding it, you will understand what I mean.<br \/><br \/>That said: Despite the fact that nearly all the restaurants reviewed are in London, a city where I do not live, the immense pleasure these reviews give far outweighs the fact that I will most likely never \"sample the delights\" that Mr. Rayner has had the (mis)fortune of experiencing.<br \/><br \/>If you like biting, witty, acerbic humor by someone who is unafraid to speak his mind, this book will not disappoint you. Mr. Rayner covers the waterfront, from the interiors, the waitstaff, the starters, the mains and the desserts. He also points out the prices, which all seem to be astronomically high.<br \/><br \/>He begrudgingly acknowledges a few dishes (rarely) as hopeful, but the majority of his praise (slight though it is) is, oddly, almost always reserved for desserts. It simply must be that those are the few items on the menu he finds successful.<br \/><br \/>In this way, the reviews do seem to follow a pattern and after he described yet another dessert that I didn't think really needed to be mentioned, I got a bit bored. But... soon enough I found myself howling at his descriptions and observations, and part of the great joy I experienced was knowing that I didn't have to pay a pence to suffer the hell this poor man did.<br \/><br \/>There were numerous one-liners that I burst out laughing at. The only one I'll share here is: \"You could easily respond to this week's restaurant with furious, spittle-flecked rage.\"  It summed up so much.<br \/><br \/>Nothing misses Mr. Rayner's incredible sharp eye (or his sensitive tongue, I might add), and the reader can revel in descriptions that make each restaurant, waitstaff and dish come alive in ways that are fresh, novelesque, poetic and hysterically funny.<br \/><br \/>If you enjoy the wit of a great food critic, this is the book for you.","parent_asin":"1783351764","timestamp":1583634320606,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true}
{"rating":5,"title":"Serious stories of innocence & experience; highly recommended","text":"In reading Donald Lystra's story collection, SOMETHING THAT FEELS LIKE TRUTH, I was struck by its overall air of quiet thoughtfulness, a quality not often found in contemporary fiction, particularly the shallow sort often topping today's bestseller lists. Because there are no werewolves or vampires here, no scenes of bloody violence or bodice-ripping passion. Indeed the only aberrations you'll discover in these stories are the unspoken thoughts and suppressed desires of outwardly ordinary men and women, living their lives of quiet desperation, silently straining toward some undefinable other - wishing and wondering as they fill their finite days with mundane mind-numbing jobs and activities.<br \/><br \/>This yearning quality, this \"Is That All There Is?\" feeling permeates many of Lystra's stories, beginning with the first, \"Geese.\" Its protagonist, Glenn, tries to remain aloof from the scary spectre of his brother-in-law's \"exploratory\" surgery, but then, in agreeing to put down the man's ailing old dog, is suddenly confronted with his own fear of isolation and death. \"Nothing about today seemed normal, nothing at all,\" Glenn thinks as he talks to his wife on the phone. \"I heard her breathing on the wire. My heart was going like crazy. 'Don't hang up yet.'\"<br \/><br \/>That wondering if there might be more to life continues in other stories: with Tom, a laid-off factory worker in \"Marseilles;\" with Norm, a night shift bus driver in \"Hesitation;\" and with Eleanor in \"The Five O'Clock Train.\"<br \/><br \/>The theme of the heart, as a fragile physical organ, crops up throughout the collection too. One of the stories, about a bitter, divorced architect is titled, for obvious reasons, \"Bypass.\" Following a visit from his ex-wife, Frank touches his scarred chest, feeling \"deep within, the reassuring buck and shudder of his imperfect heart.\" And the protagonist of \"Speaking of Love Abstractly\" has undergone an angioplasty. Recently separated from his wife and tentatively attracted to his much younger French tutor, Harold asks his doctor if his heart is healthy enough for sex. The tutor is young - and French - enough that she doesn't know who Walter Cronkite is. She's given no first name in the story, identified only as \"Mademoiselle Carnot.\" Puzzled, I wondered fleetingly if perhaps this were a gentle jest on Lystra's part, combining carnal (as in carnal knowledge) with Bardot (as in the French sex-kitten actress from the fifties that only older men like myself and Lystra might remember). Nah, probably not.<br \/><br \/>There is too a push and pull between innocence and experience found scattered among the stories. Several could be considered coming of age tales - \"Reckless\" concerns a young boy on a hunting trip with his father; in \"Treasure Hunt\" a seventeen year-old grapples with family loyalties; in \"Scout\" a boy worried about his father's serious illness discovers a derelict's dead body. And in \"Family Way\" (the story which spawned Lystra's critically acclaimed novel, [[ASIN:0875806287 Season of Water and Ice]]), twelve year-old Danny's attention is divided between his own sexual awakening, his parents' failing marriage, and a new friend, a pregnant teenager.<br \/><br \/>The final story in the collection, \"Bridge,\" will make comparisons to Hemingway inevitable. In it, a sixty-something year-old makes a long-postponed pilgrimage to Seney in Michigan's Upper Peninsula to retrace the journey of Nick Adams in \"Big Two-Hearted River,\" the story first published in Hemingway's collection, IN OUR TIME, more than eighty years ago. The protagonist in Lystra's story, identified only as \"the old man,\" is hoping to find something out about the truth of Hemingway's story, to bridge the gap between fact and fiction, and in so doing, to make some sense of the choices he's made in his own life.<br \/><br \/>Hmm ... Looks like I've somehow managed to invoke Thoreau, Blake, Hemingway, and even Peggy Lee. But the truth is these pieces are pure Lystra - every one a perfectly polished gem of storytelling. There are no fillers or discards. In fact, each of these sixteen stories holds, somewhere within it, SOMETHING THAT FEELS LIKE TRUTH. If you are looking for serious fiction for grownups, read this book. I recommend it highly.<br \/><br \/>- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir, BOOKLOVER","parent_asin":"0875806937","timestamp":1378047798000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false}
{"rating":5,"title":"A Must Read For Both Hunters and Non-Hunters","text":"Meat Eater is a fantastic read that I would recommend to anyone.  Outdoor writer and TV show host, Steven Rinella, shares the hunting stories from his past that have molded him into the person that he is today.  He explains his love for hunting and the outdoors when he was growing up in Michigan.  He explores hunting for various types of game and the things he learned from these various experiences.  He reflects deeply on hunting in general, trapping, fishing (which he considers a form of hunting), hunting ethics, the beliefs of non-hunters, and culinary tips for preparing wild game.  Much like his previous book, American Buffalo, Rinella takes us on a spiritual journey through the past and through our own souls.  I enjoy Rinella's writing and enjoy watching his TV show (also called MEATEATER).  This was a heartwarming and amazing read that makes me anxiously look forward to his next book.","parent_asin":"0385529813","timestamp":1353335056000,"helpful_vote":8,"verified_purchase":true}
{"rating":1,"title":"Good story or no, it's a grammatical nightmare that often becomes unreadable","text":"I almost feel bad posting this review, but after reading every other review posted, I can't help but feel like some perspective is needed. I won't argue that Wren has a decent idea for a story here - there's something compelling about being plunged into a mentally deranged mind, and Wren's character seems like it could be okay as it goes. But to put it plainly, KILLING HIS FEAR is absolutely unreadable. Filled with misspelled words, typos, run-on sentences, comma splices, and more, Wren seems to be hoping that a decent story will allow a reader to ignore all of the grammatical errors along the way. The reality, though, is that the book often becomes incomprehensible, and even when you can follow it, it's a chore to get through. I don't ask that a writer be perfect - heck, that's what an editor is FOR. But I do expect that if you're going to ask people to read your book, there needs to be an indication that you've spent some time cleaning it up and making it presentable, and KILLING HIS FEAR doesn't show that in the least. If Wren hired an editor and cleaned this up, I might give it another shot. But as it is, I'm glad all these people liked the story. But it doesn't make up for writing that shows an absolute lack of understanding of grammar and conventions.","parent_asin":"B009ACC4L2","timestamp":1384457865000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false}
{"rating":5,"title":"Correctly identified the Book of Mormon Lands","text":"Venice Priddis has properly identified the lands of the Book of Mormon.  She came to these conclusions on her own based on the scriptural account without preconceived ideas. She does go out on a limb on some very specific cities and other locations and may or may not be correct on each of them- there is not enough evidence or scriptural account to say either way. But in general she is very accurate.<br \/><br \/>Another author Del Dowdell also set out over 25 years ago to see if he could identify the Book of Mormon Lands by strictly following the scriptures. He never knew about Venice Priddis but came to the same locations. His books and blog are incredibly well documented, scholarly, and follow the scriptures to the word- always. His blog is at nephicode.blogspot .com.<br \/><br \/>I have studied every Book of Mormon geography theory out there. Perhaps every book ever written on Mesoamerica theories. Then more recently North America theories including Heartland, etc. also the Malay theory. In the last few years I have read over 5000 pages about the South America theory and reread the Book of Mormon multiple times highlighting every scripture (over 500) that has any reference to geography, culture, prophecies, etc that may shed light on where the Book of Mormon lands are. The South American model fits every single word of every single scripture. No other model even comes close. If you are interested in where the Book of Mormon lands really were I highly recommend this book and the works of Del Dowdell.","parent_asin":"0884942775","timestamp":1500603033373,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true}

We recognize a true hero in a fireman rushing into a burning building to rescue a child, someone giving up a kidney to help save a loved one, a teenager jumping in freezing water to rescue a sibling...<br \/><br \/>Then there is also a different breed of men...Born heroes, their unwavering love for flag and country their driving force in a life filled with dangers...They give it all!<br \/><br \/>Marcus Luttrell and co-author James D.

New York:  Scholastic, Inc.<br \/><br \/> Synopsis: Oh the length a caterpillar will go for a delicious meal!  You will wonder just how far this hungry little creature will go to find a satisfying meal to fill his belly.  Carle is a timeless author that continues writing stories that capture and enchant the minds of young children with this tale of a little caterpillar searching to find a fulfilling meal. This caterpillar's story has a beautiful ending.<br \/><br \/> Evaluation: This story presents the early learning concepts of counting and the days of the week.  The only discrepancy is that in the end the caterpillar builds himself a cocoon.  Moths build cocoons, while butterflies build chrysalises. Carle's story provides children with easy to understand language that they are sure to repeat over and over.  Young children are mesmerized by Carle's unconventional use of smaller pages.  Little fingers cannot help but explore the tiny holes created throughout the book by the hungry little caterpillar.  Eric Carle's vividly painted tissue paper collages continue to draw children into the imaginary worlds he creates.  These simple painted collages are uncluttered on a crisp white background and keep children's attention spans.  The counting patterns assist children with the one to one correspondence needed for early math skills.  As well, children can't help learning the days of the week with this fascinating tale. As youngsters begin to learn to count and recite the days of the week, this story offers children the opportunity to use repeated readings to fully grasp these concepts.  In addition the counting and days of the week patterns provide children with some predictability.","parent_asin":"1852691247","timestamp":1178468432000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":3,"title":"LIght reading for Flames fans","text":"I was stuck in an airport for several hours and looking for something to read I came across this book by hockey broadcaster extraordinaire Peter Maher and sports writer George Johnson, whose columns I'd always enjoyed.  The book is focused on Peter Maher's recollections of his career, the people he's met, and some of the big games along the way.  The story of how he started in broadcasting was mildly interesting, and it was fun to recall some of the Flames' highlight moments, in the sense of \"Oh, I remember that!\".  Peter Maher is apparently a man of high integrity, and mentions in the book that he would never betray a confidence.  He also clearly comes from the school of thought that holds \"if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all\".  There is much to admire in his character, however it does make for a rather boring book.  There was very little about the Flames that one would not have learned from  following them over the years.  Almost any hint of scandal or misbehavior is glossed over.  I would have loved to read  Peter's unfiltered opinions and learn a little more about what really went on behind the scenes.  The talking walls in the title seem to be firmly in the broadcast booth, not the locker room or the GM's office.  This seems to be one of a series of such books that many NHL teams are putting out and I guess one couldn't expect much more.  If you're a Flames fan looking for some light reading you can pass a few pleasant hours with this.  If you're not a Flames fan look elsewhere.

Good enough that I'm likely to buy extra copies for distribution (and in one case, already have).<br \/><br \/>Those of us who believe, as Rinella does, in hunting for purposes of sustenance, conservation, self reliance, and preservation, have been waiting for an articulate defense of our views (whether we realized it or not).  It was particularly refreshing to see another hunter echo a viewpoint I've had for some time, but almost never hear from my fellow hunters:  that the author, like me, has more respect for a vegan or vegetarian who sticks to their principles, than for a person who eats pre-packaged meat but is unwilling to get their hands dirty and thinks hunting is barbaric.<br \/><br \/>You want organic and free range?

{"rating":5,"title":"Understanding the Modern American Hunter","text":"I loved this book.  It was a page-turner, realistic and unflinching.  The author doesn't hide his regrettable past behavior, rather drags it into the light and explains what he learned.  I have been around hunting my entire life, and have been hunting since I was legal at age 12, and was pleased to see that a guy from Michigan who has hunted the world could have so much in common with a guy from Idaho who has only hunted his home turf.  The storytelling is tangible, the experiences relatable, the motives translate to anyone who has questioned their own reasons for doing what they do.  Buy a copy for the hunter in your life, but make sure the non-hunter in your life reads it, too.  Those who are unschooled in the ways of hunting may come away learning even more than those of us who are afflicted with &#34;MEATEATER&#34; syndrome.","parent_asin":"0385529813","timestamp":1354315186000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true}
{"rating":4,"title":"More Good Eating (Reading) From Steven Rinella","text":"I'm a big fan of Steven Rinella. I can relate to the collection of stories in this book and it is that, a collection of stories from Steven's adventures as a hunter, fisherman, and fur trapper. I appreciated that the author didn't sugarcoat the stories by leaving out some of the less than legal\/moral choices that he made whether it be trespassing or firing into squirrel nests. I feel that if they're going to write about their life an author needs to bare all and pull no punches. The only reason I didn't give the book five out of five stars is because I'm comparing it to Steven's superior American Buffalo: In Search of a Lost Icon.","parent_asin":"0385529813","timestamp":1379958432000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true}
{"rating":5,"title":"Good & Gritty","text":"There was a time not so long ago, Steven Rinella points out, that \"there was no hiding from the fact that we have to kill to eat.\" Today, \"we've devised all sorts of clever mechanisms that enable us to avoid this reality. I'm thinking of grocery stores, restaurants, that sort of thing.\"<br \/><br \/>In \"Meat Eater,\" Rinella takes us through a lifetime of hunting, from small game to big mammals and he contemplates how, at least in 21st Century America, we have lost touch with our connection to the process that puts protein on our plate. \"We've probably entered a period that will one day be regarded as the autumn of hunting,\" he writes. \"However, you should not consider this book to be an act of submission. It is not a tearful farewell. Rather, I think of hunting--and of writing about it--as a form of resistance. It's an insurgency, an act of guerilla warfare against the inevitable advance of time.\"<br \/><br \/>\"Meat Eater\" provides a chronicle of Rinella's hunting life--and each chapter focuses on a different prey and location, complete with between-chapter \"tasting notes\" to help make your harvest more palatable.<br \/><br \/>Not only is Rinella a gritty hunter, he is a powerful writer and that makes \"Meat Eater\" a smooth read. Rinella doesn't pull punches when it comes to the degree of difficulty hunting, but the woes of a hunter are seen as just a fact of life, not a badge of honor. It's readily apparent that even the most experienced hunters can encounter plenty of trouble in the wild and, sometimes, come home empty-handed.  Rinella is self-effacing, earnest and, in spots, very funny.<br \/><br \/>Vegetarians, of course, will not read this book (unless they are looking for further reinforcement for their reason for not eating animals). But all others might enjoy a writer who can make you feel like you've picked up a scent and closes the gap between food source and nourishment.<br \/><br \/>Writes Rinella: \"I've learned to see the earth as a thing that breathes and writhes and brings forth life. I see these revelations as a form of grace and art, as beautiful as the things we human attempt to capture through music, dance, and poetry. And as I've become aware of this, it has become increasingly difficult for me to see hunting as altogether outside of civilization.\"<br \/><br \/>I also highly recommend Rinella's, \"American Buffalo, In Search of  lost Icon.\" He is a smart, sharp writer with many fine stories to tell.","parent_asin":"0385529813","timestamp":1354467496000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":2,"title":"The Sofa Needs Reupholstering","text":"P. J. O'Rourke at his best is acerbic, hyperbolic, and insightful.  His genius for satire can sit somewhere near Jonathan Swift, especially when O'Rourke reflects facts through a fun-house mirror.  Observations become an emblematic retinue for O'Rourke's underlying thesis, and the thesis is made human through humor.  Readers often laugh first at others' folly, then recognize themselves in the mirror.<br \/>The CEO of the Sofa has both laugh-out-loud-at-them and laugh-out-loud-at-me moments.  When O'Rourke hits his stride on fatherhood, teenage driving, and travel in India, he brings the folly of others and ourselves into view.  The Sofa is unfortunately threadbare as the other 200-odd pages are uncomfortably self-indulgent.  O'Rourke repeatedly bemoans both the lost days of his youth and that he spent them in misguided delirium (sounds more like mid-life crisis tempered by mid-life morals).  His supercilious observations on the Democratic neighbors and the Political Nut lack the steely-eyed confidence of earlier works and are rather shaky literary threads holding this whole cloth together.<br \/>In short, Sofa is reminiscent of a dulling author offering up lesser essays.  To fill out the book he stuffs around the original pieces all those clever, undeveloped ideas found in his desk on scraps of paper.  O'Rourke can pour himself a celebratory drink because his desk is now clean, but the Sofa is in need of reupholstering.","parent_asin":"0871138255","timestamp":1004345007000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":1,"title":"Wako-Wacko Geography","text":"This is probably the most amusing book ever written in defense of the Book of Mormon. Priddis believes that the whole Amazon basin was flooded by the ocean some 1500 years ago, not millions of years ago in the days of the dinosaurs. This would create a \"narrow neck of land\" between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans (the Andes Mountains forming the pass).<br \/><br \/>Because there is no evidence of any great battles at Hill Cumorah near Joseph Smith's hometown in upstate New York, most modern Mormon scholars claim that the Book of Mormon Hill Cumorah was somewhere else.  This in spite of the fact that Joseph Smith claimed to have found the gold plates of the Nephites at the New York Hill Cumorah, and in spite of the fact that early Mormons claimed that the hill was full of lost Nephite treasures.<br \/><br \/>The other reason for moving Hill Cumorah out of New York is to put it near the regions of high civilization in the New World--pagan civilizations, one should add.<br \/><br \/>The Cumorah problem has led to identifications of Hill Cumorah all over both North and South America.  Priddis believes that Hill Cumorah might be Imbabura at 15,033 feet in the Andes (p. 57).  \"It is a very interesting hill indeed.\"  A hill? at 15,033 feet!  Most people would call that a \"mountain.\"  Tens of thousands of warriors battling it out at 15,000 feet!<br \/><br \/>But that is not all. The Nephites were supposed to cross the narrow neck of land from sea to sea in a day. That would be quite a climb in height and distance to cross the Andes Mountains.<br \/><br \/>But let no septic go unanswered. Priddis says, \"To many, cerro Imbabura, Cayambe, and Hermoso would be mountains, but one man's mountain can be another man's hill.\"  Indeed.<br \/><br \/>The possibility of rational discussion vanishes when a writer cannot concede that a mound of earth fifteen-thousand-feet tall is probably not a \"hill.\"<br \/><br \/>Priddis' proposal, however, goes beyond anything ever written on the subject. She presents a map showing the \"Probable Geophysical Configuration of South America Before the Time of Christ.\"<br \/><br \/>But this Mormon South America is one that has not been seen in millions of years--the Book of Mormon \"west sea,\" \"east sea\" and the \"narrow neck of land\" wind up in Ecuador. All that is left of poor old South America is the land surrounding the Andes Mountains---or perhaps, we should say the Andes \"hills.\" Priddis writes:<br \/><br \/>\"We cannot know how a lone man (Mormon), of himself, could have made the  long trek from South America to North America to bury the plates in a hill in New York State.\"<br \/><br \/>And carrying all those heavy gold plates, one should add.<br \/><br \/>Indeed, why make the journey at all? The Angel Moroni took the plates from Joseph Smith and disappeared, so why not just fly them up to the false Hill Cumorah, where the yearly Mormon pageant is held--a pageant depicting the last days of the Nephites at the Hill Cumorah in New York.<br \/><br \/>The theatrical setting and story of the Book of Mormon simply does not translate well into the real world.<br \/><br \/>First came the end of two million sword-carrying Jaredites at \"Hill Cumorah.\" There \"had been slain two millions of mighty men, and also their wives and children\" (Ether 15:2).<br \/><br \/>Hundreds of years later, the Nephites were also wiped out at the same Hill Cumorah.<br \/><br \/>\"And we marched forth and came to the land of Joshua....the Lamanites had a king, and his name was Aaron; and he came against us with an army of forty and four thousand. And behold, I withstood him with forty and two thousand....And it came to pass that we did contend with an army of thirty thousand against an army of fifty thousand\" (\"Mormon\" 3:6-25). This was in 346 AD.<br \/><br \/>With all these stupendous sword-carrying armies, what happened to all the swords? Why are they not found all over the Americas?  How could such civilizations have disappeared without a trace?

The abuse though is slightly touched upon.I believe the author really touched the heart with this book it was very sad but yet it's stuff that happens every day highly recommend great for book discussion for children pertaining to race relation and possible an introducion to knowing about abuse.","parent_asin":"0440219604","timestamp":1065282956000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false}

Her mixed heritage manifests itself in her skin color, thereby setting her apart from her peers in America.  Not quite fulfilled by her life in Ameica, she moves back to Jamaica and encounters the poverty and hopelessness of the native blacks, along with hatred directed at her because she is lighter-skinned than the rest of them, and comes from a more privileged upbringing.  At several points, Clare witnesses the despair and hatred breaking out into violence.  One of these is when the mansion of a rich white man is burned down by poor blacks.  Overall, the book is an interesting read, and shows how neither culture, American and Jamaican, are truly open and accepting, and what happens to someone who tries to fit into both.","parent_asin":"0452275695","timestamp":1124997365000,"helpful_vote":11,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":5,"title":"Living By Your Wits","text":"Somerset Maugham says that it is difficult to write in the first person in fiction, however, this is a true story with great immediacy done so, never brought to television or the movies since, perhaps, because parts of it are top secret. Nonetheless, if Quentin Reynolds' works were properly read the old colonial fools that talked America into a war with China (Vietnam) would have done otherwise. Yes, this is the escape of Lt. C.D. Smith and two companions from a Japanese prison across 700 miles of China countryside at the end of World War II. It is written as if it was told into a tape recorder while it was happening at times. To hold off from immediate payoff, you get suddenly taken back in time to learn of the nautical experience of this lowly-ranked (though gifted) boat captain (12 years waiting to join the Shanghai Pilots Association; rare for an American) and how he acquired his ocean-going skills. This flashback also gives you the maritime history of merchant and other sailing vessels up to the war. 'Smitty' Smith was well-schooled in the ways of the world before his captaincy of the U.S.S. Wake at the start of the book. Under arrest on Dec.7,1941, C.D. Smith was treated humanely and loosely at first because of his local prestige; more than that he was fluent in the native languages and culture. At the time of escape, he and his companions had endured 27 months or more of brutality and starvation. It goes without saying that his companions were toughened customers. The way they planned and executed their escape would seem routine to those who've read of other 'escapes.' But this escape deserves to be read by those who might be frightened by a Chinese invasion of some kind. China has been invaded by outsiders for thousands of years but never defeated. You will find out why and other surprising cultural details only if you follow the windings of the escapees through unchartered territory, facing the unknown every night, risking capture at every turn. How do the escaped prisoners avoid capture every night? Is it with weapons or wits? They were never fired upon nor used weapons but every night death or capture was as close as the next hut. This is an exciting story with a remarkable flashback about the seafaring days that produced unforgettable men like C.D. Smith who dare to live.","parent_asin":"B000JDT7L6","timestamp":1381017554000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true}

{"rating":4,"title":"Not meant to be the first book you read on MCMC","text":"I am a fifth year graduate student in Psychology. I was assigned this book as part of my readings for candidacy. I also had this book for a seminar course on Bayesian methods. The first time I encountered this book during the course, I must admit that I found it difficult to read, so I ended up not being motivated enough to go through with all the assigned readings. I have taken 2 graduate level courses on Bayesian modeling. I have now finished reading 6 chapters of the book as part of preparing for my candidacy exam and I am glad I took another shot at reading this book. I now understand fairly well issues with MCMC, what the limitations of Gibbs sampling are, when Metropolis-Hastings is typically used and why convergence diagnostics theory is hard. All of these are important practical issues for anybody who wishes to use these methods in their work.<br \/><br \/>As other reviewers state, the writing can get dense sometimes. I skipped over some stuff that I felt was too much detail for my purposes and yet came away with a certain level of confidence about the knowledge I gained from the book. If you are ready to work out some of the derivations yourself and if you are willing to attempt to solve some of the exercises (which I did in my grad level class), you will get the most out of this book.<br \/><br \/>So in conclusion, this is a must read for anybody serious about understanding Bayesian methods but this shouldn't be the first book you read on the topic.

{"rating":4,"title":"Interesting, Informative Read","text":"It has been quite awhile since I read an autobiography. While some might not categorize Rosaria Butterfield's journey into faith as autobiographical, I do and I always leave an autobiography learning new things and being exposed to different perspectives.<br \/><br \/>In this case, I learned tremendously and had an eye-opener on many issues, for I was born into a Christian home and never experienced a pre-conversion life as Butterfield had. Overall, I am ignorant of homosexuality and homosexual's general ideas\/beliefs and have only known a few homosexuals on a work-related and school basis. I was very curious as to how one who lived as a lesbian and worked within lesbian studies for so long traveled and survived the journey to Christian faith. It was not pretty, that is for sure! Butterfield uses her talent as an English professor(do you know how many times I scratched my hand, wondering what a word meant?!) to share her inspiring, wonderful story of transformation. She tells her readers her battles, her sorrows, and her triumphs. She shares the many people in her life that God used to guide her to the path of Christianity. All in all, Butterfield's story was an interesting one about the Christian faith.<br \/><br \/>I encourage anybody to pick up this book. You not only read an interesting story, but you also are refreshed on Scripture applicable to anyone's life. While I do not agree with everything Butterfield says, she certainly makes you stop and re-evaluate how you can be a better person through serving others through the grace and strength God daily gives to us.","parent_asin":"1884527388","timestamp":1425506368000,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":5,"title":"kinky fantasy is highly recommended to dark erotic readers who let their deviance roam freely","text":"Relationships change over time. Becoming close to someone and sharing experiences with them can create an intimacy which pulls a person away from the person they currently love. For Mab, she knows Tabby is the one she wants forever. Tabby thinks this is what she wants too. But when she learns about Prince Rowan and she's already fond of him, how will this work? Rowan can be the sadistic Master she enjoys and he is someone who understand her in a different way due to his experiences. Their footing is also more equal than Tabby to Mab.<br \/><br \/>This is a complication in the story which may make a few readers feel twisted up and anxious. Mab's relationship with Tabby is multilayered as it continues to mature and grow. Or more specifically, as Tabby's beautiful butterfly wings emerge as she metamorphosis into a force to be reckon with, the way Mab relates to her changes. Tabby's growth is truly an inspiration to witness. Ms. Blevins does a nice job of showing the difficulties Tabby struggles with as her position in the Fae world increases. Tabby is not power hunger. She is an insatiable pain slut who loves being under her lover's power. Both Mab and Rowan fill that desire and it makes it difficult for all.<br \/><br \/>This story is more than relationship tangles and dark as hell kinky shenanigans. There is also personal growth for Rowan and changes for him. Their ever evolving relationship over time is nicely done in a concise manner. I have mentioned it before, and I will mention it again. Ms. Blevins does a bang up job when it comes to compressing time into meaningful chunks. Time flies and yet it doesn't feel rushed. There is just the right pace so the important pieces to the story are delved into with more detail and emotion. The &#34;time lapsed&#34; writing is done in a way that gives a good highlight and doesn't come across like a space filler. Ms. Blevin's pace in this story helps bring closure to open threads and start new ones. I love it.<br \/><br \/>I am not going to provide any spoilers regarding the sex and kink scenes. Suffice to say, they are hard, intense and wince worthy. The kink is designed for those who revel in intense sensations and dark passion. Did I get arouse? Yes. Did I feel a bit disturbed that I was aroused? Not anymore. I've joined the dark side and since Ms. Blevins enticed me with much better things than cookies.<br \/><br \/>Just when I think this story can not continue anymore, Ms. Blevins throws in another subplot which looks to like it will bloom into the main plot for the next and final installment. This story ends in a fairytale manner and I can't wait to see what happens after the happily ever after. This kinky fantasy is highly recommended to dark erotic readers who let their deviance roam freely.<br \/><br \/>*I received an advanced copy. A review was requested.

{"rating":3,"title":"Out of Opaque Rage","text":"Dyer's quasi-treatise on D.H. Lawrence amused me to no end when I started reading it.  Although the book's subtitle -- WRESTLING WITH D.H. LAWRENCE -- leads one to believe the book is about the famed author, it is actually more about wrestling as a life choice.  Wrestling with one's desires, one's life, one's hopes and dreams.  Dyer's opening pages flicker back and forth between the occasional comment on Lawrence, mingled with rambling monologues on how he manages to sabatoge his own pursuits due to his overwhelming tendency for procrastination and self-doubt.  \"One of the reasons, in fact, that it was impossible to get started on either the Lawrence book or the novel was because I was so preoccupied with where to live.  I could live anywhere, all I had to do was choose -- but it was impossible to choose because I could live anywhere.  There were no constraints on me and because of this it was impossible to choose ... when all you have to go on is your own desires, then life becomes considerably more difficult, not to say intolerable.\"<br \/><br \/>This kind of ironic introspection is a clever counterpoint to Dyer's actual academic purpose, but it stales with use.  Dyer uses the exact same formula to explain why people don't wear seatbelts, why he's bad at DIY home projects, why his knee hurts, and why he always brings the wrong books on his various vacations.  On the one hand, it's kind of funny.  On the other hand, the same joke over and over gets old.<br \/><br \/>Dyer's conceit here is that he mingles these long-winded mutterings with the occasional delve into Lawrence's own life and letters.  He does this with seamless skill at the beginning (noting, for example, that Lawrence himself struggled with the decision of where to live), but the further along his book progresses, the more the technical analysis juts out, at odds with the rest of the awkwardly intimate details that Dyer gives of his own life and losses.<br \/><br \/>What ends up happening is that you get a vague idea of what Dyer and Lawrence are\/were both like as people, but without ever getting the full force of that rage that the title claims is there.  The book's title is derived from a quote by Lawrence, but it would've been more accurate to have replaced \"rage\" with \"despair,\" since the book is less about Dyer and Lawrence than it is about how to wrestle with the overwhelming amount of ennui and confusion that all people (but writers especially) must deal with on a near-daily basis.<br \/><br \/>The goal is lofty, but the book's answers are a bit pat, especially when Dyer wraps things up and feels compelled to put a neat, little bow on the top of the sloppy, endearing mess he's just created.  What starts as a humorous co-mingling of philosophy and self-sabotage turns quickly into a poor blend of a literary exegesis with a caustic self-help concept.  \"That is the hallmark  of academic criticism: it kills everything it touches,\" Dyer writes.  He hopes to expound on Lawrence by using his own life -- \"...how can you know anything about literature if all you've done is read books?\" -- but since his life is such a shoddy and repetitive affair, his novel becomes equally shoddy and repetitive.

Knight's a good looking black woman who is also an outstanding detective is partnered with Parker. The case is twisted, but the murder was an attempt to cause the bar to close and be bought to make way for Hearn's planned neighborhood rebuild. Greed, street gang enforcement, and two timing women are all characters in the plot. Interesting read, but not to far from documented actual true cases.

I started reading this book after ordering it for a family member... and ended up getting a copy for myself.  As we get older we tend to stay in our comfort zone, but they say the secret to staying young is to try new things?  My recommendation for those of a similar attitude would be to use Amazon's \"Look inside\" feature where many (many!!) pages of this book are available to preview.  As other reviews have pointed out, there is also a kit available which includes components needed for the projects.  After starting the book, i went ahead and got a kit.  In my opinion, it is well worth the extra $$ b'cuz it makes it simple to get started.  Unless, of course, you enjoy surfing the Internet looking for components, but my age... simple is better :)","parent_asin":"1680450263","timestamp":1544731567529,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true}

It also included the effects of his death on his family and how his feelings about the war in Iraq changed during his service there.  This book gave some insight into the Iraq war and gave me a new perspective on it.  This book is a bit of a mystery because at first you don't know which soldier is the killer and then it turns to suspense as the killer puts his plan into action.  I read this in two days because it was captivating and I liked Abby, the main character who was the army widow.

Also I was worried I wouldn't be able to tell if it had the correct information and was afraid to be embarrassed giving him an incorrect reference card! However when it came in I realized it's actually three sheets put together and both front and backs are filled out with info! Some sections included are: weld joints and positions, types of joints, types of welds, ISO symbols, AWS symbols, parts of the weld, welding processes by letters, etc. there are also many pictures and diagrams to show you exactly what to do! I have no welding experience or back ground and I could understand a majority of it just by looking at pictures (no I'm not planning on attempting any lol) another useful feature is they include conversion tables! They're included for length, area, and volume! There's also an English conversion that tells you what prefixes mean and what that number is written out. Example: mega... million...

Looking for a new direction in life, Linda yearns for adventure in her hopes of becoming a glamorous flight attendant. But, when she fibs her way into a job as an au pair in the Loire Valley of France, she soon discovers that her expectations aren't quite in line with those of her new employer. The story flows nicely as she paints a picture of the quaint towns and rolling hillsides of her new home, but the highlights for this reader were the vignettes with the children, especially little Antoine. His adorable one-liners and interactions with Linda never ceased to brighten my mood. The relationships with the rest of the family are nicely developed throughout the book, and the dialogue reads well. Don't be surprised when you see French dialogue on the page, though, because it is a convention that carries throughout. Overall, I thought that Francophiles and casual readers alike could enjoy this story, and I personally can't wait for a sequel!","parent_asin":"1457514575","timestamp":1351717980000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false}

When his soundman and best friend is found murdered while on an investigation concerning a secret group, Bullseye gets cancelled.  Bullseye was Jake's livelihood, so without any clear direction and his dream job nixed, he spirals into a deep depression.  Fast forward a few years, and we find Jake newly married and on his honeymoon with the love of his life. This honeymoon does not go as planned though as the events from the past collide with the present and Jake must find who is behind the secretive group and a killer.<br \/><br \/>The Good Spy Dies Twice is filled with tense action that held me in its grasp right from the beginning and was impossible to put down. Mr. Hosack’s uncanny ability to create a plot that is both engaging and thrilling kept my interest throughout – needing to know what would happen next.  This well written, fast paced thriller is raw, gritty and suspenseful with extreme amounts of action and solid, well-developed characters.<br \/><br \/>I was a bit leery to listen to this audio book due to it being narrated by the author himself.  Sometimes authors just need to the leave performance of their book in the capable hands of professional narrators and just concentrate on the writing.  My thinking though was quite wrong in this instance – a whole lot of wrong.  Mark Hosack narrated this book outstandingly.  His voice is crisp and concise, with pacing that was perfect.  Not only was the narration top notch, each chapter begins with sound effects that not only complement the story but in my opinion adds a level of uniqueness that sets this audio book apart.<br \/><br \/>Overall, if you love action packed thrillers then you don’t need to look any further than The Good Spy Dies Twice.  Mr. Hosack is a masterful story teller and amazing narrator who has created a thrilling story that is filled with just enough twists and turns to make your head spin. This was a great start to the series and I can’t wait for the next installment.<br \/><br \/>Story – 4 stars<br \/>Performance – 5 stars<br \/>Overall – 4.5 stars","parent_asin":"B01N9SPMAO","timestamp":1494242766000,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":true}

{"rating":5,"title":"Best book to get started in electronics--and even get more advanced!","text":"Awesome book with awesome tutorials!! I've attempted to major in electronics engineering long time ago and found it so overwhelmingly difficult, most of all due to the level of math involved that I just had to switch majors to abandon it altogether.  My love for electronics continued over the years though (but not math). Many years after my follies with electronics engineering, I stumbled upon this book and voila!  Basic concepts that I had struggled to understand by just mathematics alone now make full sense thanks to this book. The key: the author uses a method where he makes you work backwards, by building a circuit first, making run second, and then explaining the scientific (and mathematical) principles behind it! I can tell you that as a high school teacher, this is the best way to learn: hands-on!  The only one downside of this book is that you have to be prepare to spend a lot of dough if you want to complete every single of the experiments that are suggested here (i.e., soldering irons (30 to 40W as well as a 15W), perforated circuit boards, lots of resistors, capacitors, transistors, LEDs, etc. However, the money will be wisely spent if you seriously want to learn electronics. One more recommendation, there a great (free) site that's called &#34;EveryCircuit.com&#34; which lets you put together electronic circuits from schematics and run them to see the effect. This could be an awesome companion to this book for it shows you exactly what happens when you turn on the switch (in an animated graphic) by following how the current flows on your circuit. I've copied the schematics from the experiments on this book and assembled the same circuit on the website after I completed the experiment just to have another view of what actually happens with all the electronic components on a particular circuit.","parent_asin":"1680450263","timestamp":1494557297000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true}

{"rating":3,"title":"Skip the filler, re-read the good parts","text":"I'm a big PJ fan, and found much in 'The CEO of the Sofa' to enjoy. The problem is the good parts are embedded -- like a fly in amber -- in a conceit that never really clicked: PJ's homage to Oliver Wendell Holmes's 'The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table.'<br \/>What PJ has done here is create a semi-fictional community, and embedded his essays (à la Holmes) as monologues delivered to these family members, friends, neighbors, and his long-suffering assistant, Max. To his credit, PJ is very up-front about what he's trying to do. In the Acknowledgements, he writes, 'Holmes pulled this [conceit] off with so much wit and charm that there was only one way I could pay his idea the compliment it deserved. I swiped it.' Like a successful actor or director, PJ seems to be in a position to get his publisher to indulge his personal pet projects. Like Holmes, PJ is witty. Charming, I guess, is a matter of taste. I found it dull and contrived, and skipped over it as quickly as I could in order to get to the actual essays.<br \/>The good news here is that most of the essays are PJ in fine form. Fans of 'Parliament of Whores' will savor his coverage of the United Nations Millennium Summit. And if you enjoyed his deconstruction of Jimmy and Rosalyn Carter's tome way back when, you'll prize the way he tears apart 'Guidelines for Bias-Free Writing' and (especially) 'It Takes a Village.' ('The village is Washington. You are the child.').<br \/>Interestingly, the parts I found most funny were those that involved, or were suggested by, Christopher Buckley. The Blind (Drunk) Wine Taste Test and the section titled 'Who the F___ Are They?' are, for pure humor writing, some of the best things in the book.<br \/>It was Christopher Buckley who coined the equation PJ = SJ [Perelman] + LSD, but you won't find much of the latter in this book. The author of the classic 'How to Drive Fast on Drugs while Getting Your Wing-Wang Squeezed and Not Spill Your Drink' now finds himself writing about childcare, the stock market, and the vicissitudes of home computers. These are some of the sections I skimmed over, as PJ veered terrifyingly close to (Lord have mercy) Andy Rooney-dom.<br \/>Despite those scares, though, there is still great material here. I found the occasional recycled joke, but there are also many true O'Rourkean one-liners to enjoy ('What a feckless, timid, timeserving [Republican] revolution that was in 1994, as if the sans culottes had stormed the Bastille to get themselves jobs as prison guards.' [p. 102]).<br \/>So ... good try on the Holmes thing, PJ. It wasn't my cup of tea, but *de gustibus ...*. The rest is still worth the trip.","parent_asin":"0871138255","timestamp":1005676235000,"helpful_vote":7,"verified_purchase":false}

The gap between rich and poor is horrendous,and Cliff does a great job getting into the minds and motivations of the unschooled, illiterate, unknown although everywhere poor.

{"rating":5,"title":"Very highly recommended -- outstanding book","text":"Regardless of whether you're learning electronics as a high school or college student or on your own, you want this book.<br \/><br \/>The author's approach is simple and direct: instead of getting bogged down in theory in the way most textbooks do, he leads you through a series of discoveries from a number of hands-on experiments with various electronic components -- resistors, capacitors, transistors and the venerable NE555 timer.<br \/><br \/>Although you can learn considerably just from reading the book, I very strongly recommend that you do all the hands-on experiments; there's simply no substitute for sitting down with a breadboard, a handful of components and building something.  You can either buy the companion parts kit and get everything you need (saving time), or buy a generic kit like https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01ERP6WL4 and buy the missing parts separately, saving some money.<br \/><br \/>One thing I would recommend is that you get a second multimeter.  For some experiments, I found it very helpful to leave one hooked up to the circuit with alligator clips to measure voltage or current, and using another multimeter to do spot measurements.<br \/><br \/>One thing worth noting is that the author relies on color to help you identify connections, which is a bit of a problem if you're reading the book on the Kindle Paperwhite.  When doing the experiments, you'll definitely want to either have the printed book or read the e-book on a computer or a Kindle Fire.","parent_asin":"1680450263","timestamp":1478626659000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":4,"title":"PJ O'Rourke's latest","text":"As any conservative or Libertarian can tell you, we needed a sense of humor to survive the last few years of the Clinton Administration and luckily, a few brave humorists like PJ O'Rourke were there to provide it.  O'Rourke's latest book, the CEO of the Sofa, is a collection essays covering the end of 2000 and the first few months of 2001.  O'Rourke presents them in a slightly new format that will probably catch his fans off guard.  In an hommage to Oliver Wendell Holmes' The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table, O'Rourke's essays are worked into a fictional narrative that details the opinions and reactions of O'Rourke's skeptical wife, his children, his generation Xish (or is that Yish) assistant, the Democrats next door, the Political Nut who Lives Around Here, and others.  Through these asides, O'Rourke paints himself as a somewhat befuddled, middle-aged ex-Hippie trying to make his way through a world that's started to move past him.  Personally, I enjoyed these experiments though I know that several other O'Rourke regulars did not.  It's a matter of taste, really.  It does somewhat lessen the sting of some of O'Rourke's barbs to then read about his inability to use the internet and I don't think it would be wise for him to continue this format as I really don't see what else he can do with it.  Still, as a one-time experiment, it makes for an interesting read and it doesn't change the fact that his critique of modern American politics and politicians remains as hilarious and sharp as ever.  Highlights include his analysis of the United Nations, his recap of the impeachment trial, fairy tales rewritten for Democrats, and his examination of whether or not Hillary Clinton is actually secretly very stupid.  Other highlights include a wine tasting excursion with Christopher Buckley and an essay on celebrities O'Rourke has never heard of.  As always, O'Rourke's barbs will warm the heart of anyone who could bring themselves to believe that Bill Clinton was actually the leader of the Free World.  As others have stated, the book's experimental nature probably makes it prohibitive to people who are new to O'Rourke's style of writing and humor but if you're a fan of PJ O'Rourke's, you'll find much to enjoy in this book.","parent_asin":"0871138255","timestamp":1013546509000,"helpful_vote":8,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":3,"title":"OK for O'Rourke fans, not for novices.","text":"CEO of the Sofa is an uneven book.  It's basically a collection of some of P.J.'s writings on everything from Hillary Clinton to driving to being a new father.  It is linked together in an homage to Holmes' &quot;The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table&quot; as a series of diatribes P.J. unleashes on the Democrats next door, his assistant, his wife, his daughter, his godson and the baby sitter (usually as his alter ego, the Political Nut).<br \/>I can't, in good faith, recommend this book to non-P.J. fans.  The wit is there but the book lacks the coherence, factual analysis and dogged persistence on a subject that characterize his best books - Eat the Rich, Parliament of Whores and All the Trouble in the World.  Even his previous collections - Vacations in Hell, Give War a Chance and Age and Guile - had related articles sandwiched together in sections.  This just sounds like someone rambling on and on from topic to topic with no rhyme or reason.  If you're not familiar with O'Rouke, I recommend the above-mentioned books, which are excellent.<br \/>Some of the stuff in the book is very good.  Some of it isn't.  His open letter to Democrats, his discussion of how being a parent changed his outlook, his (well-deserved) lambasting of Hillary and his analysis of the impeachement scandal in which no side is spared his sharp tongue, are top notch.  But the CEO linkages annoyed me.  Moreover, he took his old articles and pasted in asides to his (fictional) audience.  The pasting is obvious and the asides are unnecessary and distracting.  If he'd just done this as a coherent collection of his writings, it would probably be a 3.5-4 star book.  As it is, it's 3-3.5 stars for PJ fans, probably less for novices.","parent_asin":"0871138255","timestamp":1003273956000,"helpful_vote":29,"verified_purchase":true}

O'Rourke is neither as funny, smart, clever, intelligent or savvy as he thinks he is, nor as he would like us to believe he is.<br \/>In CEO of the Sofa, a loosely connected collection of some of his random and previously published works, he takes the pose of someone working from home to discourse about everything from cellular phones, and driving lessons to a trip to India he took several years before.

Somehow, though, it never comes together in a way that made me care.  I think this is because the author's real strength is in creating a feel for place.  He didn't do very much to create empathy or revulsion with his characters.  He tries, all right.  His description of the plight of one particular victim is enough to disgust.  As for making me feel the ambiguity around most cops, I've already seen what they are capable of--I wouldn't be in the least surprised to discover that one of them is a serial killer.  I think the twist near the end is designed to surprise, but it is unfolded in such a leisurely way that I wasn't.  Blauner lacks passion.

{"rating":4,"title":"An au pair experience gone bad...","text":"When I was 14 years old, my parents sent me to Ireland for 3 weeks so that I could practice the English language I was learning in school. This was a full immersion trip which meant I would stay with an Irish family for the whole duration of my stay with no contact with other French speaking students. The family who hosted me lived in the suburbs of Dublin, and they had a girl my age who had decided before I even arrived that she didn’t like me. She went out with her friends, and left me at home with nothing to do. With virtually no money and very little experience due to my age, I couldn’t very well go exploring Ireland on my own! Let me tell you that these were the longest 3 weeks of my life! I felt all alone in the world.<br \/><br \/>But this was nothing compared to what Linda Kovic-Skow went through when she went to France to be an au pair. Her plan was to spend a year there in order to learn the language. When she applied for the job, she lied about already speaking French but she thought she would learn quickly once immersed in day-to-day life. She arrived in the Loire Valley in the summer of 1979, and the Dubois family welcomed her in the Château de Montclair despite her not speaking French. Linda started taking care of Colette, 7, and Antoine, 4, while pregnant Mme Dubois was getting more and more demanding, treating her like a servant.<br \/><br \/>Based on the author’s diary while she lived in France, French Illusions is a delightful read, and I couldn’t put it down. Needless to say, I identified strongly with Linda due to our shared bad travelling experiences, but I think most readers would do so too. Unfortunately, I wasn’t surprised by Mme Dubois’ behavior since she belonged to an aristocratic family, and she probably considered the au pair as paid help. I must stress though that not all French natives are like that, and I think the author was successful at showing it. After all, she bonded with several French people while she was staying at the Château de Montclair. However, I thought that the story kind of had an abrupt ending that could have been smoothed over. There will be a second book though that will come out in late 2014, French Illusions: From Tours to Paris, so maybe when the 2 volumes are read back-to-back this won’t stand out as much… I can’t wait to read the sequel to Linda’s adventures!<br \/><br \/>French Illusions was sent to me for free in exchange for an honest review.<br \/><br \/>Please go to my blog, Cecile Sune - Bookobsessed, if you would like to read more reviews or discover fun facts about books and authors.","parent_asin":"1457514575","timestamp":1412187534000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":4,"title":"Tonight I ate a T-bone","text":"I read \"Meat Eater\" by Steven Rinella about a month ago and I've been thinking about it ever since. Earlier tonight I ate a big T-bone steak, so this may be the right time to review this book. I simply enjoyed that Rinella told his stories of hunting and fishing and eating various meats in a straightforward way, without getting sentimental, without excusing it, and without (much) commentary on people who disagree with his style of life. Beyond that, I'm not sure how I want to describe this book.<br \/><br \/>I'd say that even a vegan could enjoy this book and its honesty, that perhaps some understanding could be gleaned as to why someone would choose to hunt, dress and eat an animal, that hunters may be seen as something other than beer-swilling, pickup-driving, cut-the-heart-out-and-leave-the-rest-behind terrors, but I shouldn't need to pick out any one group of people and say what they might find worthy in this book.<br \/><br \/>This book is thoughtfully written with humor and matter-of-factness from someone who seeks out and loves the connection to nature and to the animals he hunts. If that connection sounds like a contradiction, the hunting lifestyle chronicled within \"Meat Eater\" does a commendable job of explaining how hunting brings Rinella closer to his family, his pioneer heroes, his prey and his world.<br \/><br \/>So, if any of that sounds even a little interesting, you're certain to enjoy \"Meat Eater.\"<br \/><br \/>I received this book at no cost as a member of the Vine Program.","parent_asin":"0385529813","timestamp":1355631593000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}
{"rating":5,"title":"An Excellent Book About the \"Why\" of Hunting","text":"The deepest relationships you can have in life are with people (particularly the people that brought you into existence) and the things that sustain you, like food. Modernity has fundamentally altered our relationships with both people and food, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.  One thing that has changed in regard to our relationship with food is that we have become incredibly disconnected from the process that brings the food to our plate.  This phenomenon seems to be creating a growing malaise among many of today's young people, including the difficult to define hipster. [1]  In other words, we have largely forgotten that we are, at our core, hunters (not desk jockeys).<br \/><br \/>Meat Eater is a personal reflection on hunting chock-full of personal anecdotes detailing Steven Rinella's hunting and fishing adventures. It's also somewhat of a philosophical inquiry and spiritual memoir. Or as Rinella himself puts it, “this book uses the ancient art of the hunting story to answer the questions of why I hunt, who I am as a hunter, and what hunting means to me.” It turns out that Rinella believes that spiritually connecting with the food that sustains us is part of what makes us human, and with this, I wholly agree.<br \/><br \/>According to the British primatologist Richard Wrangham, cooking is what made us human (a review of his book Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human is forthcoming). I agree with Wrangham, but after reading Steven Rinella's Meat Eater, I'd also argue that hunting is what allowed us to cook.<br \/><br \/>Some may say we were &#34;born to run&#34; (which may have some truth depending on how we define &#34;run&#34;), but I think it's more accurate to say that we were born to hunt. [1]  In light of evolutionary past, it only makes sense then that the desire to grow your own food and hunt\/fish your own eat meat is as visceral a desire as there can be.<br \/><br \/>I have a confession to make though: the economist in me loathes the locavore movement and the idea of hunting\/gathering all of your own food.  However, the philosopher in me understands that there are quality differences, and ethical and aesthetic preferences, that aren't always captured in naive economic and financial analysis. [2] In other words, not everything economists call a commodity is a actually a commodity. The meat from a grain-fed industrially raised cow, for example, may be financially cheaper than wild elk meat (especially if you hunt it yourself), but that the quality of the nourishment provided by the wild elk meat, even if it's just spiritually, is different. This is something that naive rationalists cannot seem to understand.<br \/><br \/>Anyway, each chapter of the book depicts a different time in Rinella's life. In the first chapter, he describes his introduction to hunting at the age of ten for the opening day of Michigan’s squirrel hunting season. The remainder of the chapters cover everything from fishing in the Yucatan to hunting in Alaska. While there are some practical tips included at the end of each chapter, this book is certainly not to be confused for a &#34;how-to&#34; guide.<br \/><br \/>I've had the itch to get into hunting\/fishing my own meat for quite some time now. As I pursue that endeavor, it was nice to read Rinella's account of why he hunts. Before you decide to take on any new hobbies, you probably ought to figure out why you want to do it.  I've figured out why I want to hunt and fish, and I hope others do too.<br \/><br \/>Notes:<br \/><br \/>[1] See this Slate article called &#34;Hipsters Who Hunt&#34;.<br \/><br \/>[2] See my post &#34;The Case Against the Marathon&#34;<br \/><br \/>[3] See my post &#34;Protect the Environment: Eat Global!&#34;","parent_asin":"0385529813","timestamp":1361229046000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":4,"title":"O'Rourke mocks at - just about everything","text":"In this book O'Rourke is his usual savagely funny self as he gives his views on politics, welfare, medicare, republicans, democrats, the Clintons, Monica Lewinsky and life in general.  He is particulalry funny when demolishing Hillary Clinton's book 'It Takes a Village' and another bizarre book, apparently a handbook of politically correct language (this book sounded so totally weird, I wasn't sure that he didn't invent it as a joke).  His piece about India is particlarly good, nobody else writes about foreign parts as well as O'Rourke.  Occasionaly I found myself getting irritated, as when he gets all Michael Moore-ish about women, going on about how intelligent, efficient, competent, and generally more adult and better than men they are.  I hate this.  Not being at all efficient, competent and adult myself, I find myself deeply loathing Mrs O'Rourke and all thoise other smartallick women who are so different from me.  He's at it again later in the book when he's on about women being wonderful with children etc.  Crikey, all these female paragons he seems to know make me tired. And it startles me a bit to find that he doesn't believe that Elian's father had any right to have his son returned to him, as a father himself I would have expected him to be more sympathetic to father's rights. However, in general this is a very funny book (his comparisons between Venice, Italy, and Venice, Las Vegas, had me in stitches, likewise his experiments with wine-tasting).His most profound comment in the book is &quot;the difference between having one child and having two, is like the difference between keeping a dog and running a zoo&quot;  That is SO true. And his wife is probably not as tiresome in real life as she seems to be in this book.  Very funny.","parent_asin":"0871138255","timestamp":1086285446000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":5,"title":"The Longest Trail-Coming of Age Story","text":"\"The Longest Trail\" by Roni McFadden is a coming of age \"true life novel\" that tells the story of the young teen Roni during the 1960s.  She is headed down a dubious life path, which so many of us were during the 60s, until she meets a \"cowboy mentor\" that changes her life through her love of horses, and his belief in her.  This book can be read on many levels: a coming of age story; horse lovers will enjoy her stories of the many horses she cared for; her adventures packing by horse into the Sierra, Big Sur and other wilderness areas of California; and just read as a memoir.  I was moved emotionally by many passages, and by her resilance and growth. The book is well written, and the author grabs the reader from the first page.  You want to continue reading so you can know this young woman and the future path she took in life. Both young adult and adult readers will enjoy and identify with her journey.  If you love horses, memiors and just a plain good story, this is a book for you.","parent_asin":"1478235845","timestamp":1345486473000,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":4,"title":"Relaxed, quick-paced and friendly style","text":"I am reading two of Steven Rinella's books, one upstairs, one downstairs: Meat Eater and American Buffalo. The former is a walk through the woods with bow, trap and rifle seeking game for the table... with \"tasting notes\" no less! The style of both is relaxed, quick-paced and friendly. Every term that may be unknown to the reader is immediately defined, often with a surprisingly down-to-earth simile.<br \/><br \/>I have always admired writers like Ernie Schwiebert (Nymphs) and John McPhee (Founding Fish) for their mastery of background detail - they know the name and origin of every tree, bush, rock, river and ravine. But now I have a new hero -- Rinella slips in the background - exactly enough, and most often introduced  with an asterisk -- in a matter-of-fact, non-professorial manner. And after each detour, he finds a smooth path back to the main highway. If you are not a hunter, you will probably not like Meat Eater because it contains mostly the recollections of a country boy's youth and early manhood trapping and hunting. But if this one is not your meat, then check out his other book, American Buffalo. While it centers on a buffalo hunt in Alaska, it does, in its own way, for the buffalo what McPhee does for the shad.","parent_asin":"0385529813","timestamp":1354215967000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":4,"title":"A Poet's Life with some of his Verse","text":"Anyone who has tried to read the Old English of Chaucer will persevere in agony, give up, or summon the aid of a biographer. The third option seemed best for me. Peter Ackroyd’s Chaucer is brief enough to breeze through, yet inclusive enough to satisfy one’s curiosity.<br \/><br \/>This is a biography. But it is a good choice where Chaucer’s verse is concerned because his verse is so often woven into his story by the biographer, and in ways that a comprehension of that verse is guaranteed. Ackroyd accomplishes this in two ways. For shorter extracts, the ones that are chosen need no modernizing, like “’the swyftnesse and the sweighe’ of worldly fortune’s ‘turnynge wheel’” (p. 105) and “’as stil as any ston’” (p. 107.) Longer extracts are isolated from the narrative to indicate that their modern translations are to be found at the back of the book. Some of these may be easily read, nevertheless, without help from the back: “The lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne,\/Th’assay so hard, so sharp the conqueryng” (p. 88.) Through experimentation and by the influence of Petrarch, Boccaccio, and Dante (pp. 44, 45), Chaucer achieved this ‘high style,’ which later poets were to imitate for centuries.<br \/><br \/>The extract from page 88 seems to be about what is elsewhere termed ‘the craft of fyn lovynge’ (p. 32.) But it is a fit description of the arc and process of Chaucer’s composition. “Epilogues are cancelled…prologues are rewritten…lines from one tale…added to another” (p. 141.) Struggling writers will be relieved to read that. They will be interested to learn, moreover, that Chaucer relied on several tactics to carry out his writing ambitions. He fashioned characters from what he observed in certain people (p. 46.) Sometimes he conveyed credibility by injecting himself into his work (p. 145.) He disarmed criticism by self-deprecation (p. 144.) And he may have feigned more ignorance in his subject than was the case in order to come across more remarkably (p. 86.) Given the fact that a criminal could, in that day, escape the death penalty on the ground of being able to read (pp. 135, 136), a writer, especially one as talented as Chaucer was, must have been a man set apart from the crowd.<br \/><br \/>Chaucer had the advantage of being born of well-to-do parents, and served the royal court from his youth onward (pp. xiii, 1.) The fringe benefits that he enjoyed from the crown were many: rent-free property, grants, and annuities, for example (pp. 46, 52.) As ‘controller of the wool custom,’ he had one of the plum jobs of the day (p. 49.) That said, plum job appointments were not as mellow as they now are. Overseeing the wool trade ‘was not an easy sinecure’ (Ibid.) And that was only one role out of many that he filled. Some of the business that he did for the crown was positively perilous. What can ‘clandestine diplomatic business’ (p. 25) mean but that he was a spy for the king? Once he was even captured on the battlefield (p. 19.) During a royal disruption some of his peers were beheaded (p. 129.) The Chaucer who emerges from this biography is not the soft, merely bookish man that I supposed him to have been. He was a daring court official who wrote poetry on the side (p. 62.) Fourteenth century England was a tough, dangerous, and fairly lawless place and period (pp. 2, 10, 40, 41, 81, 83, 96, 97, 128, 154.) Chaucer was in the thick of it with everyone else.<br \/><br \/>Facts dropped in here and there by the author cause us to involuntarily compare Chaucer’s England with where we now are so many years hence. The ‘Stocks market’ used to be about ‘fish and flesh’ (p. 5.) A penthouse used to be a room above a shop for the owner and his family to reside in (p. 6.) A possession of sixty books was a token of ‘wealth and luxury’ (p. 59.) None of this is surprising, necessarily, but such notices imprint themselves on the mind at least for awhile.<br \/><br \/>It surprised me to learn that Chaucer besmirched his verse with indecency (pp. xvi, 30), even while inditing on the subject of judgment from God (pp. 9, 151.) Considering that he was nevertheless morally awakened enough to intimate in favor of Church reform (pp. 67, 68), it is no wonder that he came to regret the polluted aspects of his work (p. 156) and that he was smitten, not long before dying, with a sense of guilt on account of his ‘bawdy poems’ (p. 162.) The shrewd reader will recognize that Peter Ackroyd tries in vain to rationalize these facts away (pp. 157, 163.) Every writer should have his deathbed in view when flinging words upon the world.<br \/><br \/>Peter Ackroyd quotes just a word or two of Chaucer’s puerile filth, which is remarkable in light of his defense of it. He has put together a neat little biography, which is, if he got around to it, the first part of a ‘series of short biographies’ (back cover.) This commencement volume is a pretty good start. When presenting material that may be rumor as much as fact, Ackroyd’s choice of expression is guarded: ‘there may be some truth in this’ (p. 13), ‘one possible source of instruction’ (p. 14), et cetera. He summarizes a text very well (pp. 102-103.) He knows how to introduce a Latin phrase and teach it at the same time (p. 113.) He puts forth a pleasing style: ‘this comic poem of fickle fate’ (p. 80.) He is not quite, in his own words about his Subject, ‘a great magpie of other men’s words’ (p. 153.) Neither is his book, in his own words about Chaucer’s verse, a ‘considerable example and not inconsiderable success’ (p. 123.) But Ackroyd’s Chaucer is not bad.<br \/><br \/>There are a few weak moments. I came upon two distinctions without a difference. What difference can there be between ‘easy’ terms and ‘familiar’ terms? (p. 38.) What is the difference between ‘vocation’ and ‘employment’? (p. 44.) And there are scarce instances of phrasing lacking sense. What can ‘the sentence of posterity for rape’ mean, for example? (p. 84.)<br \/><br \/>Chaucer’s poetry was often delivered orally (p. 61.) What contributes to the difficulty of understanding his words on the page is the absence of gesture and expression—in short: the acting out (p. 108.) If you have been as bewildered by Chaucer’s verse as some of the women who listened to him appear to have been, then this short story of his life is something that you might appreciate. The brief excerpts communicate his meaning and rhythm. The longer excerpts, though at the expense of rhythm, are modernized to at least convey his meaning. The book is illustrated.","parent_asin":"0701169850","timestamp":1416848630000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false}
{"rating":4,"title":"A train wreck conversion","text":"Though the organization and execution of this book are flawed, it still packs a wallop.  In fact, had the author and publisher fully realized the importance of the stories they were telling, they might have spent more time rounding off its rough edges.<br \/><br \/>The pivotal account is of Butterfield's conversion to Christ from her previous career as a lesbian, postmodernist academic, a transformation that Butterfield compares to \"comprehensive chaos\" and a \"train wreck\"--certainly a remarkably different experience than the one narrated by C. S. Lewis in [[ASIN:0151001855 Surprised by Joy]].  \"I didn't choose Christ,\" she writes.  \"Nobody chooses Christ.  Christ chooses you or you're dead.  After Christ chooses you, you respond because you must. Period. It's not a pretty story.\" (81)  Nevertheless, for Christians, Butterfield's account of her conversion underscores the necessity of approaching unbelievers like herself with sensitivity, graciousness, and honest compassion.<br \/><br \/>Another significant narrative in this short book is the author's failed romance with a man who \"shared the gospel with great spontaneity and relevance\" before asking her to marry him.  Then he broke their engagement (after she had turned her life upside down to accommodate him) with the words, \"I'm probably not a Christian.\"<br \/><br \/>Butterfield's book has other pointed lessons as well, but the book runs off into apologetics for Psalm singing, the regulative principle, and homeschooling.  (I think they're all fine, but they seem inconsequential compared with say, the unchristian attitudes and non-Christian students she encounters while teaching at her denominational college--an experience that she passes off with a few sentences.)<br \/><br \/>The book does not have a proper introduction or conclusion, and the storytelling might have been tightened. For instance, there is this series of wordy sentences:  \"I started to ask other people who worshiped in the RP church these questions.  Many people seemed untroubled by these questions.  Many of my RP colleagues took a `live and let live' attitude about the worship practices that divided us.  Indeed, some of my RP colleagues were even apologetic about our worship practices.\" (86)<br \/><br \/>Still, the reader experiences throughout what I can only describe as the author's holy vulnerability and her desire to communicate the truth of the Christian gospel.  Perhaps in the future, she will have another chance to tell her important story, this time with an editor at her elbow.","parent_asin":"1884527388","timestamp":1364156520000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}
{"rating":4,"title":"Nicely crafted but lacking depth","text":"Like the more gifted Bernard DeVoto (who might have been his teacher at Harvard had not the Depression intervened), Alvin Josephy (1915- ) mucked about in journalism and fiction writing for some years before finding his métier doing history--in Josephy's case, the history of American Indians. Not surprisingly, Josephy writes gracefully, and parts of his memoir--the stories of his New York City childhood and his heroic World War II service, for instance--carry real emotional punch.  Nevertheless, Josephy easily slides over important subjects he doesn't care to discuss, such as the dissolution of his first marriage, the difficulties of writing history from oral tradition, and the decisions he made as editor of American Heritage.<br \/><br \/>Furthermore, although Josephy is proud of his New Deal liberalism, he pulls punches when describing the political personalities of his era. For instance, he describes Harry Bridges as \"a tough Australian-born dockworker\" and Howard Fast as a \"successful author honored for his writings by the Soviet Union\" without noting that both were Communists.  In other words, early on the reader begins to suspect that Josephy's political views were either more naïve or a bit further to the left than he now cares to admit.  Also depressing is his glorification of all things Indian, including Native American superstition--as if rattles and medicine bundles were privileged in a way that the mumbo jumbo of Mexican Catholic priests was not.<br \/><br \/>Josephy worked at Time magazine a few years after Whittaker Chambers, the nemesis of Alger Hiss, had resigned.  Josephy's family was nurturing, Chambers' dysfunctional.  Josephy's autobiography is nicely structured, Chambers' Witness (1952), misshapen and overlong.  Nevertheless, in Chambers' autobiography we encounter a soul, here only the persona of a facile writer lucky enough to have chosen a topic popular in his own age.","parent_asin":"0806133716","timestamp":1104703524000,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":false}

(The reverse is mostly not covered in this book.)<br \/><br \/>I think it was brave of Rinella to be so forthcoming about his various hunting stories. Personally, I am contemplating whether or not I would ever be interested in hunting, and this book is very informative- though not decisive- in that contemplation.<br \/><br \/>I do admire his general respect for the animals, and his dedication to making their deaths not go to waste (apart from the muskrats he killed as a teen for their fur).<br \/><br \/>It's a good book and I'm glad I read it.<br \/><br \/>It is not a book for everyone.

Hooray.  Doctor William McCants serves at the first ranking Johns Hopkins University but he does not let his brains get in the way of his message.  He rather writes in the style more of a journalist than as an academic.<br \/> He certainly does not skimp on detail.  He takes us through the tangled history of ISIS with all of the twists and turns, the complex inter play between the main ISIS actors and the leaders of Al Qaeda.  That alone would serve as a remarkable and informative book.<br \/> But McCants also weaves the reader though the apocalyptic religious underpinning of the Islamic State.  We simply cannot understand ISIS without having some notion of how the members view the world and their place in it.  The writings of ISIS are drenched in explicit references to the end of the world.  The rank and file members might not fully understand the theology involved but they get enough of it to want to be on the right side of Allah.<br \/>  He also gets into such things as the motivation for ISIS doing horrible things to human beings and having such pride in that horror that they film it and put it on Youtube.  One shudders to contemplate such people.  But they are not irrational, just holders of a different and pervice point of view.<br \/> I got a lot from this short 159 pages of text book.  McCants does include, as a good professor should, nearly as additional hundred pages of notes, intex and several appendices.  We owe it to ourselves to understand ISIS as best we can.

However, most of these are white-to-play-this-and-win plus a positive thinking pep talk (salted with interesting and often funny [to me] metaphors).  In other words, Lakdawala does not present a critical analysis of the opening, instead it's a defense.  However, there are glimmers of how Black could change the course of the game with different moves, move orders, and ideas. Not all the games are at the GM level and a computer is mentioned often (despite the introduction ranting against computer analysis and needing a computer proof opening that computers and theory will not dismantle).<br \/><br \/>Typically when I lean a new opening it's helpful to follow the main lines so the confusing thing is the format (which can interfere with they way I process chess information).  Typically the format, inserting questions (mostly useful) adds to the sense of understanding.  The problem is that there are times when the diagrams and the questions are off the main line.  The feeling is one of having to go back to decipher what he's talking about.<br \/><br \/>I do like the fact that most \"average\" player should be able to follow the lines due to the abundance of diagrams.<br \/><br \/>Please note, despite the 416 pages, there is less on the Colle than I had hoped for... a good percentage of the book is Lakdawala entertaining us with his sense of humor.  (e.g. his dog eating grass and ceremonially vomiting it up)  This book is not encyclopedic which is good for the new learner and not so good for those who may already have a good sense of the opening and want more depth.<br \/><br \/>Another thing that should be understood, this is an introduction to the whole Colle complex.  It covers the traditional idea of playing for e4, or the new so-called Phoenix idea of playing a reversed Slav with b4, or the \"brutal\" (Ladawala) Zukertort system.  In other words, after reading this book you will need to head for one of the books that specialize in one of these lines.<br \/><br \/>While the Colle is essential a \"one-trick\" pony (if it doesn't work then white is in trouble), it is a very good and reliable trick that new players have used effectively to stay out of early trouble against superior players.  (The London, played well is considered \"unbeatable\" while the Colle is open to debate.)<br \/><br \/>The reason this book scores so high (for me) is because it also happens to be a tactical manual.  Ladawala refers to the various attacking motifs and how to look for and combine them.  Some of them are advanced ideas and the newer player may have to search the meaning of some of the ideas mentioned.  Still it's a good attacking manual.<br \/><br \/>So if you are fairly versed in chess, looking for a solid opening with explosive attacking potential over the board, and are willing to learn a sense of timing of when something big should happen... give this book a read.","parent_asin":"1857449967","timestamp":1380850654000,"helpful_vote":26,"verified_purchase":true}

{"rating":4,"title":"Not as good as Lone Survivor, but still worth reading","text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I deeply love Marcus Lutrell. I've never met him, never talked to him, never seen him. I've only read his books. Lone Survivor touched my heart, and changed my life. It is by far my favorite book.<br \/><br \/>This book was very good, and it was nice to learn more about Marcus, but it didn't have the same affect on me that Lone Survivor did. Yes, I read it in 2 days, and yes it was extremely gripping in parts, but it still seemed to be missing something. I honestly think it may have been the different co-author.<br \/><br \/>The format of the book was somewhat interesting to me. It is broken up into 3 distinct parts. Part 1 was the most exciting to me -- the  action-filled part of the book. It talks about Luttrell's journey to Iraq and his experiences there. Part 2 takes us back to the end of Lone Survivor to explain the story behind how he was rescued. This was very interesting to hear. He also talks about how his dog DASY was shot, a truly tragic story. I had read about and listened to on Youtube, but it's nice to hear his written words about it. Part 3 was not very excited, but was good to put in the book. It's mostly sad, but truthful. We hear from various spouses to Navy SEALs, and the difficulty they have to bear in being married to SEALs.<br \/><br \/>In all, It was a great book, but it just doesn't compete with Lone Survivor. Then again, nothing does. So keep that in mind.","parent_asin":"0316185361","timestamp":1361218196000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true}
{"rating":5,"title":"Makes Me Want to be a Better\/Different Disciple of Christ!","text":"I'm nervous about writing this review because I am definitely NOT an English professor!!  This book is absolutely captivating and life-changing.  Rosaria is truthful, raw and vulnerable in her testimony, and I found myself deeply convicted by some of her insights.  For example, I deeply admire Ken & Floy and the way they \"didn't\" witness to Rosaria but just gave her time, respect, patience and friendship.  They were truly Holy Spirit-led and didn't try to help the Lord out by following a rigid schedule or pattern.  It was inspiring, too, that having received that love and time, she gives it in her ministry.  I am way too \"busy\" and wrapped up in \"doing\" and I would like to change that as a result of reading this book.<br \/><br \/>I'm not sure that I can articulate what is at the core of my deep admiration for Mrs. Champagne-Butterfield's testimony.  She seems to have such an intelligent, realistic and humble point of view.  She does not shrink back from saying that her lifestyle and attitudes were sinful...period.  But she also has amazing insight to the rigidness and fear that many of us as Christians demonstrate.  Love and compassion and a strong stance against sin are not mutually exclusive and she conveys that!<br \/><br \/>I thoroughly enjoyed the parts about the RPC which I was not familiar with and the segments on adoption\/homeschooling were very interesting too.  In fact, I would love to see her write a book exclusively about adoption.

{"rating":5,"title":"Get the companion kit.","text":"I'm an electronics newbie who has made several newbie mistakes. Here are a couple:<br \/><br \/>1. Buying a Raspberry Pi education kit.<br \/>2. Buying an arduino education kit.<br \/>3. Buying random parts for experiments I've come across.<br \/>4. Buying an online electronics course with plenty of experiments.<br \/>5. Buying this book.<br \/><br \/>Wait... what?<br \/><br \/>OK, let me tell you why those things might sound like a relatively good direction but will frustrate you, as they have me.<br \/><br \/>First, you're not ready for a Raspberry Pi or Arduino. If you can't explain Ohm's law and don't know the cathode side of an LED from the anode side, you're just not ready. The kits will tell you that you are, but unfortunately, that's just good salesmanship, not reality.<br \/><br \/>In reality, you need to understand the basics of electricity and electrical components first, because think about it- how will you know what to apply the Pi or Adruino boards to? If you don't understand timers, resistors, capacitors, spec sheets, etc., you're really getting in over your head with the boards. True, you'll be able to follow instructions and build stuff, but you won't really know why it works or why it fails to work. You won't even be able to diagnose any problems you run into. That said, wait to get an Arduino and\/or Pi. They're not going anywhere fast and you'll get to them soon enough.<br \/><br \/>Next, here's why the online course route could trip you up, and it's why this book may trip you up. Supplies. Every teacher is going to have different examples and, though some parts (led's, various capacitors, solid core wire, resistors, etc.) are likely to crop up again and again, some won't. In fact, many may not. One course may ask for a specific relay, the other a certain speaker or IC. This doesn't make either teacher or lesson plan bad, per se, but I advise you pick one and work all the way through it. They'll usually tell you which parts you need for the course up front, which will save you a lot of trouble and headache.<br \/><br \/>Lastly, get ALL the required parts BEFORE you begin the first demonstration\/project\/etc and get EXACTLY what the instructor has specified. I can't stress this enough. They'll often tell you if you can substitute items (e.g. various multimeters or calipers), but usually they'll tell you specifically what you need and you should get specifically that for all projects the course covers.<br \/><br \/>I mean, think about it, let's say the course has 20 projects and each one requires a trip to an electronics store (if you're lucky) or, more likely, a shipment from Amazon. You're going to be waiting around awhile between projects that could take as little as ten minutes to set up and run. That's frustrating. That's where I am. That's why I strongly encourage anyone who gets this book to get the related kit. Amazon does sell it (currently $86USD):<br \/><br \/>https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/ProTechTrader-Make-Electronics-Component-Educational\/dp\/B01EKO6FYQ<br \/><br \/>I'm not saying it's the only method of learning electronics, but for this book, man... it'll help you to have it.<br \/><br \/>As for this book... this is an absolute gem. I almost gave it four stars for the 'have to buy all those electronics parts to make it work', but come on- that's really not fair. You're going to have to buy electronics parts no matter what course you take anywhere you go and Pratt tells you up front that you need the stuff. My mistake shouldn't detract from the author's work.<br \/><br \/>This book will get you far. It starts out with the most basics, provides outstanding illustrations and takes you up to the Arduino. For a single book on electronics, it packs a pretty hefty punch. When the author feels something may confuse the reader, he clearly points it out. There will be some readers who will require secondary sources to understand a few concepts better- but that's common to all topics in all education. My thinking is that you're not going to need many secondary sources if you carefully (slowly!) follow along with the author, which makes this one of the better electronics books out there.<br \/><br \/>BTW... a lot of electronics authors like to fry things to show you things can\/will fry. I find it a little silly, but some people like that. There's a fuse experiment and LED experiment here where he shows you that'll happen. Personally, I'm happy to take his word for it, but thankful he explains exactly why it's happening.<br \/><br \/>Outstanding book, but man oh man, get the electronics companion kit to go with it.<br \/><br \/>02 Oct 2022 Update:<br \/>The protec trader parts kit is a great value and worth it, but it's not perfect and not all you'll need. Here are some additional purchases that'll make life a little easier:<br \/><br \/>1 set of leads w\/ alligator clips on the end. The ones in the kit are really small, hard to handle and bite into the electronics more than I'd like because of their small springs in the clips.<br \/><br \/>Additional spools of 22AWG solid core wire in colors that correspond to the experiments in the book. I recommend the dafruit 'hookup set', which includes black, red, white, blue, green and yellow (6 rolls, 25ft ea. @ $15US)]. You can get by with black, red and a third colored wire, but it's really nice to have the additional colors so I can follow along exactly with the book.<br \/><br \/>The Hakko FX888D soldering station with an additional precision conical tip (T-18i). If you get an additional tip, be sure you get one that fits the FX888D (T-18 series). It's a great soldering station that does all you need, quickly adjusts to the temperature you need and takes up very little space.<br \/><br \/>1 spool of lead-free solder.<br \/><br \/>1 silicone soldering mat.<br \/><br \/>After completing the 10th experiment, I can safely say having a really great set of magnifying glasses and magnifying lamp help tremendously. I wouldn't be able to manipulate these very tiny parts without those tools.<br \/><br \/>The other tip I would add is to solder solid core wires to your stranded 9V connectors.","parent_asin":"1680450263","timestamp":1631377165277,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

Fans of historical fiction will enjoy the attention to detail of Mr. Shepherd's novel. The vibrant 19th century streets of Wapping come to life with colorful descriptions and you can feel the influence of the docks expanding and taking over the area. But for thriller fans out there, there's an 'orrible gruesome murder (or two, or three, or four) which needs solving by the wonderful detective duo of Horton and Harriot - a duo I hope to meet again in a future novel by Mr. Shepherd. These murders, too, are based on the real-life Radcliffe Murders in London which shocked the local community. Add to this the parallel storyline featuring the swashbuckling pirate adventures of Billy Ablass, and you truly have a novel that has a little bit of everything to please readers of all kinds of fiction.<br \/><br \/>For a debut novel, Mr. Shepherd's writing is precise and assured, and he displays a vivid imagination. The narrative rips along at a fair old pace. There's a great story here, which keeps you interested and intrigued throughout, and the attention to detail and meticulous research that the author must have performed is admirable. Yet, admittedly, probably my favorite chapter was an inner monologue solely involving Constable Horton as he sailed down the Thames alone on his way to investigate clues about the case. Personally, I really enjoyed those more introspective moments and would hope to see them in Mr. Shepherd's future novels.<br \/><br \/>For fans of thrillers, historical fiction and adventure there's pretty much something for everyone in The English Monster and that's why I recommend it wholeheartedly.","parent_asin":"B005GG0N1E","timestamp":1339707039000,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":4,"title":"\"Can You hear me? Can You see him? He's My Son.\"","text":"Over the past couple of years, I have not read as much in the suspense and thriller genre as I normally do, mostly because I read almost exclusively for the purpose of reviewing rather than free reading, but also for the sake of enjoying more peaceful stories. Nevertheless, when the opportunity arises to review a Christian suspense book, I tend to go for it. It makes for a nice change of pace once in a while, especially when the author is one I know spins a good yarn. Last year I read “Stratagem” and was very impressed, so I was eager to read another novel by Robin Caroll.<br \/><br \/>As soon as I heard that “Dead Silence” featured a court sign language interpreter, Elise Carmichael, as the main character, I was in! This despite the political aspect, because as much as I hate politics, I have always been fascinated with sign language. I watched the 1962 film version of “The Miracle Worker” in high school so many times that I had all of the dialogue memorized. So this book beckoned to me, and even more so when I learned that Elise’s seven-year-old son, Sawyer, is deaf and mute. Elise’s job and skills are what entangle the two of them in a harrowing investigation related to the assassination of Senator Lilliana York, Elise’s mother-in-law. So far, so good; I appreciated that while this story takes place in the political realm, the mystery and suspense are the focus, and I honestly had a difficult time putting it down due to the quick pace.<br \/><br \/>Caroll skillfully writes a strong faith element into “Dead Silence.” Elise has drifted away from God in bitterness and anger over her son’s perceived disability and her husband’s death, which makes her a sympathetic character whose coming-home journey is fraught with distrust and fear. Most of us can relate to some degree: “Maybe that’s why she had been so resistant to turn back to God. Putting Sawyer, the one thing, the one person she loved more than anything else in this world, into anyone else’s hands besides her own terrified her.” We know from Scripture that God causes all things to work together for good for those who love Him (Romans 8:28) and that He is higher and greater than all else, and Elise comes to truly understand this throughout the novel.<br \/><br \/>There are some points of this story that kept this from being a 5-star read for me. While I can attest that many people do not know how to do their jobs, I found the degree of ineptness demonstrated by the FBI in this book rather farfetched. Elise and her entourage are more capable and have more connections than I thought likely, as well; although I loved their proficiency, I did not think it very credible overall. Some details are left out, such as how the assassin enters the Senator’s home undetected, and one of the main characters in the beginning of the story suddenly drops out for the rest of the narrative. I did think that the ending was too tidy and abrupt after all of the detail and the rather slow passage of time prior, but I was nonetheless rather pleased with the resolution. All of this is to say that while I did have some issues with certain elements, I still enjoyed “Dead Silence” very much, and if you are able to suspend disbelief a bit, this is a gripping story of murder, conspiracy, healing, and the power of both a mother’s love for her son and God’s love for us.<br \/><br \/>I received a complimentary copy of this book through Celebrate Lit and was not required to post a favorable review. All opinions are my own.","parent_asin":"1643523317","timestamp":1592714682939,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false}
{"rating":5,"title":"Great advice\/insight for fathers","text":"\"All-Pro Dad\" by Mark Merrill is the perfect book for dads. This book has 8 chapters, each one based on a different fundamental concept of being a man and a father. Each chapter title is written in the form of a question, and includes concepts such as: What Should I Model to My Children? How Can I Better Love My Family? What's My Purpose?<br \/><br \/>\"All-Pro Dad\" is full of insightful wisdoms for men - turning the societal ideal of manhood on its ear. Mark Merrill uses a compilation of stories, insights, and observations in building the groundwork for being a successful father to your children. Each chapter has a short series of steps that help illustrate the values and how to implement them into a daily life. Also, each chapter ends with a \"Huddle Up and Ask Your Child\" section, that encourages you to find out how your children see you through a series of questions. This also allows you to interact with your children and understand their perceptions.<br \/><br \/>This book would be a wonderful tool for any father - and would make an awesome Father's Day gift! I think that there is so much great wisdom and insight in these 200 pages - it is almost certain that it will really make you see fatherhood in a completely different light. I would give this book a 5\/5, without a doubt. Wonderfully written, concise, and so insightful.

{"rating":5,"title":"A deep and influential work","text":"This book continues to influence my thinking about society more than any other I've read in the last ten years. Sakaiya's concept of &quot;social subjectivity&quot; as being one of the  driving forces in societal evolatuion has provided a frame for thinking about why people behave the way they do, and has lao provided me witha potent pltfrom for fdeveloping my own brand of paradigmatic thinking.<br \/><br \/> This is not an easy read. The first third of the book is an intricately detailed primer on Asian culture history. Sakiya uses this deep histiry to set up the epochal trends that he sees. To a Westerner not schooled in Asian history, it was a tough read because Sakaiya assumed familiarity with some of the historical figures and events that I  didn't possess. Yet for me this history opened a lot of avenues in terms of seeing history unfold over a MUCH longer timeframe than the average Amerrcna is accustmoed to or comfortable with.<br \/><br \/> Once Sakiya gets into the present and points to the future, however, the book fairly crackles with unique ideas about the types of fundamental processes and defintions that constitute a &quot;knowledge value society&quot;. The core value or operator is nuance. The ability to create nuance, in fasbhion, music, art, or even terrminology, is the source of value in a knwoledge value society. The tools for aiding ion te creation of nuance, and the networks for conducinting nuance are likewise the core utilities in this kind of society.","parent_asin":"0870119427","timestamp":871674871000,"helpful_vote":10,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":5,"title":"Personal story told with disarming grace, it will educate and inspire as well as call us to change","text":"A story of conversion to Christ is always refreshing and encouraging, but the story of Rosaria Champagne Butterfield is more than that, it is faith-restoring. Her story reminds evangelical Christians that the saving power of the gospel really is bigger than the contemporary “threat” of homosexuality. The book addresses the homosexual question from the inside out, and illustrates what an incarnated gospel ministry and a church full of people who have the compassion of Christ can accomplish through Christ.<br \/><br \/>Rosaria Champagne was a tenured English professor and chair of feminist studies, at Syracuse University. She was also an outspoken lesbian. She was up and coming and making a name for herself. But then, she was abruptly stopped in her tracks through an encounter with a kind Reformed pastor who took the time to interact with her on a column she had written in the paper. She didn’t know how to classify his letter, it didn’t fit in the fan mail category, nor was it hate mail. Eventually she was drawn into a friendly exchange with him and slowly he began to shatter her perceptions about Christianity. Over time, she was drawn to faith in Jesus Christ, and slowly came to reject her identity as a lesbian and found new life in Christ.<br \/><br \/>Her story is told with honesty and charm in an autobiographical account titled &#34;The Secret Thoughts of an Unlikely Convert: An English Professor's Journey into Christian Faith.&#34; In her book, Rosaria Butterfield recounts her conversion and her growth in understanding the Scriptures. She recounts the struggle it was to be accepted as a redeemed lesbian in conservative Reformed circles. She shares her struggles and misteps in forming healthy relationships, and shares some of her steps on the way to marriage. She recounts her husband’s ministry and her involvement as a ministry partner and home-schooling mother. She also opines about problems she sees in Evangelicalism, including our modern obsession with our rights to sex. She also defends exclusive psalmody in worship.<br \/><br \/>This “unlikely convert” speaks with a disarming grace, that educates, inspires and aims to help us all change. She attacks the hidden part of us which may loathe the homosexual, and illustrates how genuine ministry will be messy and will prize making a difference above staying safe. Her story is a call to the church to come out of her cocoon and take the saving gospel of Jesus to the world around us.<br \/><br \/>I listened to the ChristianAudio production of this book. The recording was extra special in that Rosaria read her own book. The emotion and flavor of the audio recording was certainly enhanced with the author as narrator. The book is quite short, but profound. I highly recommend it. It will challenge and inspire, encourage and perhaps unsettle. Above all, it will magnify Christ.<br \/><br \/>Disclaimer: This book was provided by christianaudio.com as part of the christianaudio Reviewers Program.

His caustic wit and blend of skeptical conservatism, often well-oiled with gin and always with a healthy irreverance for do gooders, allows him to pack a good quip into almost every sentence. He takes the mundane, the politically correct, and the traditional and stands all of them on their respective heads.<br \/>His take on child rearing books as a good description of management training is spot on. His hard knocks on both Gore and Bush during the campaign are much more illuminating than what we get from the mainstream press. His acerbic review of Hillary Clinton's &quot;It takes a village&quot; finally puts that ill-conceived book and concept to rest. His general maturation from a young, hip conservative to a middle-aged one might make some old fans and current skeptics wince, but he has not mellowed with age.<br \/>Yes, you have to have a certain sense of irony or cynicism to enjoy O'Rourke.

Last read December 12, 2019 to December 16, 2019.<br \/><br \/>This author is no longer with us, but I was curious to read at least one of his books. This is very intricately plotted, with a murder that seemingly has no motive, and two others involving a intriguingly unusual method of killing.<br \/><br \/>Seicho Matsumoto is not the first Japanese author I have read, but he is the first to let me leisurely stroll through the many investigative trips of inspector Imanishi to other parts of Japan in search of the killer and the history of where he came from. In doing so, it let me remember how courteous and thoughtful of others the Japanese are, or at least were in the 1960s. From bustling Tokyo to Osaka and Kyoto; to a very small, impoverished mountain village in the northeast, you become aware of the different dialects that are spoken, as well as the differences in living conditions from one prefecture to the next; you travel to parts of this island nation that you might never have a chance to otherwise.

{"rating":4,"title":"Lots of information, but presented well","text":"A Most Dangerous Book by Christopher Krebs is a great telling of history as it is more of a story than a standard historical account. Krebs spans the journey of the ancient booklet Germania through 2000 years of history and numerous phases of a Germany desperately searching for national identity. For disclosure, I had to read this fairly quickly for a class, however, even at an accelerated pace the story was clear enough to follow with fairly little hiccups. Krebs is meticulous in the information and characters included in his tale but finds a fairly straightforward and sequential flow. Krebs succeeds where many scholarly articles fail in the area of integrating these several historical characters. Rather than dropping names across the story with perhaps a quick background sentence and a citation to another article, Kreb’s story format excels at extensively presenting the lives of each figure brought into the mosaic humanity’s interaction with Germania. It is in this way that before they are referenced to as important influences or spawning certain consequences, we already know who they were and may formulate our opinions on the why. It is easy to overdo this however, as every storyteller knows they must keep a balance between introducing necessary background and dragging on tangents. While not by any means perfect, Krebs gives a fair amount of tangent to people depending on their importance to the story. As there were spans of history where Germania generated less intrigue and\/or controversial reactions than others, there are parts of the book that feel extended out of obligation to fit the associated passing of time. Specifically, the section of the book that deals with the search that ultimately rediscovered Germania, spanning the 14th and 15th centuries, seems overextended than its significance as a hunt for ancient literature by competing scholars entails. Or, at least in comparison to the history of Germania’s manipulated evolution and the earthshaking consequences the story was created to attempt to explain. Overall, A Most Dangerous Book is a story told more compelling than 2000 years of history should be and told in a clear, proper flow, while mostly hitting the mark on properly portioning all the interwoven strands that is the story of the legacy of Germania.","parent_asin":"0393062651","timestamp":1573187498264,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":4,"title":"A little meandering","text":"I really enjoyed the beginning of this book.  Rosaria is a talented writer (she should be, having been an English Professor) and doesn't mince words.  I love the way she describes her conversion and an outsider's perspective on the church.  It was a good reminder of how we need to treat others, especially those that we deem to have a &#34;shocking&#34; past.  Isn't that why Christ came?<br \/><br \/>I got a little confused towards the end of the book.  She talks a lot about marrying later in life, the decision to adopt several children, homeschooling, and the Reformed Presbyterian church.  I was simply reading this from a biblical Christian standpoint, not a Reformed Presbyterian standpoint.  Their style of worship that she describes, with conviction (a Capella and only from Psalms) seemed odd and is not something I agree with.<br \/><br \/>Overall, this is the story of an unlikely person coming to Christ.  It didn't have a real end- it just kind of ended.  I suppose this is because her story is still being lived out, but I found that it felt more like the book was unraveling.  I would still recommend to a friend, but I would preface it by saying study the Bible for yourself- don't take someone else's word for what it says.  I agree with a lot of what she said, but there were things that I definitely disagreed with.","parent_asin":"1884527388","timestamp":1365198010000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true}

Time travel presents a challenge to the author and reader alike. D.B. Jackson has mastery of the pitfalls and gives us a story that only continues to ramp up in tension .<br \/>There is quite an expansion on the magickal beings that the humans call demons. We were introduced to the Tirribin, Shonla, Arrokad, and Belvora in book one, and in book two we learn their history, and their habits. Even their emotional needs are explored in detail. Our antagonist is revealed in a fashion which will catch you unaware as your sympathies toward him develop. Suddenly your understanding of the motivations behind the acts becomes very personal. It’s very emotional to witness the baring of hearts desires.<br \/><br \/>The ongoing story is continued with Tobias, a time walker, and his efforts to keep himself and the young infant princess of Darjean alive. Their travails are harrowing and heartrending. With his time travel, Tobias has created a misfuture. Only those extremely sensitive to time would be able to sense that the place and circumstances of their day to day lives were wrong somehow. Mara, a fellow student of Tobias at the Windhome Castle finds herself sensing the wrongness of her days. The Tirribin, Droe, who in another time had befriended Tobias, shows Mara a different past and Mara, a spanner, begins trying find a way back to where Tobias is now.<br \/><br \/>The assassins of the autarch of Oaqamar, who have wiped out all but one of the royal family of Dajearn, are desperate to find Tobias and the princess. With the advantage of more advanced tri-sextants, they still risk all, including the revelations of the devices to an earlier time, to hunt and kill Tobias, Mara, and the princess. Even enlisting the hated Belvora to aid them. It seems as if there is no place in time they can hide.<br \/><br \/>This impressive second book has merely impressed on me the absolute skill of the author. I found it nearly impossible to put down.

I suspect because of both time0line and the very small numbers of qualified me to take up arms in this capacity.<br \/><br \/>Service is an amazing book written by a real American hero, Marcus Luttrell, who was in injured in Afghanistan and rescued in an elaborate mission. Since then he has served in Iraq, retired from the navy, and taken up a number of entrepreneurial aspirations.<br \/><br \/>What can be said about it?  I honestly don't know where the Navy finds these men. They seem to have plenty ready to try to live to this standard.  But few make it through the training.  This book details a little of what it takes to be at the tip of the spear and focuses on what it takes to push that spear point into the soft flesh of nation's our enemies.<br \/><br \/>One of the more enjoyable things about this book remains how humble the author appears to be about his moment in history. I suspect it has a lot to do with the character of the man. Like he said, \"those who have done something don't have to brag about it.\"  I also enjoyed knowing that his faith is critical to his foundation as a man.<br \/><br \/>I also enjoyed knowing that the man who saved him in Afghanistan came to visit Lutreell in the United States. The difference in cultures was rather interesting to read about. We have so many freedoms in our country that many of them are simply taken for granted.  This man understands that.  I suspect Mr. Luttrell also understands it better than most.<br \/><br \/>This is a top shelf book.  It's easy to read, extremely well written and edited, and a joy to read.  It's not exactly for the faint of heart. It gets into some of the dirty work men like Marcus Luttrell deal with on a working level. Amazingly, he has a twin brother who also served in the same capacity.  This book rather dramatically shows, integrity and character of the United States and those who serve her.<br \/><br \/>Reading this book was a rather humbling experience.  If you enjoyed it, I would strongly suggest obviously reading Lone Survivor by Marcus Luttrell, American Sniper by Chris Kyle and My life in the Red Circle by Brandon.

{"rating":5,"title":"Intro book for the beginner, handbook for the intermediate\/advanced","text":"**Intro**<br \/>This is a nice electronics book. It starts out basic enough that I would say an enthusiastic student in 4th grade or higher, with ample support from their parents could probably get into electronics as a hobby by beginning with this book. It is also suitable for much more advanced people if they are willing to skip the first third of so of the book where the basics are. I meet this category, since I'm a Mechanical Engineer (but importantly, not an Electrical Engineer), and I'm happy to have bought this book just the same.<br \/><br \/>**Notable positive features**<br \/>1.) This book is substantial. It has glossy pages, color photos, and is 325 pages long. The pictures are bright and sharp. This is the second edition, and the author described the things that have been improved from the first edition.<br \/>2.) There's a lot of basic info for accommodating beginners, and a good brush-up course for more advanced people. It tells how to solder, identify resistors, install and use things like IC's and LED's without burning them out, etc. It tells the basic facts about electronic components, like what IC's, LEDs, and capacitors *are*. It recommends tools and where to get tools and equipment from. It encourages you to experiment in order to learn, like it tells you how to actually go burn up an LED just to see how much (or how little) abuse they can take.<br \/>3.) It has helpful info to explain the subtle electrical engineering concepts that have always confused me, like the difference between a relay and a transistor, and what the three leads on transistors do. My college electronics textbooks didn't do a good job at this, so that's the sort of thing that I'm getting out of this book.<br \/>4.) It has safety information. Soldering safety. Shock hazard safety. What you should and shouldn't be afraid of.<br \/>5.) It doesn't jump into wiring diagrams instantly. It uses photos and other types of sketches for people who haven't mastered wiring diagrams yet.<br \/>6.) It has little bits of electronics history in it in the form of photos of the scientists and engineers from history, and captions under the photo. This keeps things entertaining without filling the text with unwanted extra info.<br \/>7.) There is information toward the end on how to program software for your own contraptions using Arduino, a fun, versatile, and cheap software that is good for programming robots and other things.<br \/>8.) There are some neat example projects, including a crystal radio (a radio that doesn't need batteries).<br \/><br \/>**Comparison to Hacking Electronics by Simon Monk**<br \/>This book is pretty similar to Hacking Electronics by Simon Monk, and those interested in the topic at hand should consider both of these books. Both are well written, cover a similar spectrum of topics, have color photos, and have glossy pages. I would say both are equally good in writing and content *quality.* This book is slightly longer than the Monk book, and thus has more content, so I like it slightly more for that, because I'm a little more advanced, and I tend to want as much info as possible so I can use it as a reference or handbook. Finally, this book seems a little better for hardware tinkering people than the Monk book, since the Arduino part in this book comprises a smaller percentage of the whole book than in the Monk book.<br \/><br \/>**Summary**<br \/>If you want to get into tinkering with electronics for fun, or want to learn more about electronics via a &#34;learn by doing&#34; approach, this is definitely a good book. It starts out basic enough that you can probably start from the very ground level, with knowing almost nothing. I think this book would also be good if you are teaching grade school or middle school students about electronics. Finally, this book would be a good handbook for the shop of a maker, circuit bender, hobby roboticist, or anyone else that likes to tinker with electronics, and needs an occasional reminder about resister color codes, for example, or how to hook up transistors.<br \/><br \/>I recommend this book with essentially no reservations!","parent_asin":"1680450263","timestamp":1442888887000,"helpful_vote":114,"verified_purchase":true}

{"rating":5,"title":"If Mid-Atlantic Wrestling was a special part of your life: this book is for you!","text":"We live in a time when words often have lost their real meaning or at minimum have been overused and, in some cases, used incorrectly. For me, I think of the titles like Icon or Legend. Regardless of the field, be it entertainment or sport, these two terms can find the right application and can undoubtedly find a laughable use. It seems that in these modern times if a person gets more than five minutes on television or maybe one song played on the radio, they get recognized as some big deal. It is not long after that many are often labeled as a star or even more significant a legend. The world of professional wrestling is something I have been around nearly all my life. My time goes back well over 45 years. I would say that one of the fondest memories of my childhood was going to the matches with my dad on Friday nights. It as a magical time. Every Saturday morning I could not wait for Mid-Atlantic Wrestling to come on television. My hero was Wahoo McDaniel. Sharing the same last name, as a kid, I thought that was the coolest thing ever. TV on Saturday morning was great, but it was Friday nights at the historic Charleston County Hall that I got to see Wahoo in person. He was just like on television; he wore the headdress and everything; the five-year-old me was mesmerized. My hero was real; I could touch him, I could get his autograph, he spoke to me; it was awesome.<br \/><br \/>Add to this that Paul Jones was there, Johnny Valentine too. Ric Flair would eventually be a massive part of Friday nights in Charleston. Rufus R. Jones, Blackjack Mulligan, Greg Valentine, Jack Brisco; all the stars came through the hallowed Hall. Then the ’80s came, and the Boogie Woogie Man stole the show and rocked the whole building. Mr. Henry was probably never the same after those shows. Why am I giving this history lesson for a book review? It is merely because Dick Bourne has done a phenomenal job in capturing an enjoyable part of history and for me personally, a considerable part of my life. Mid-Atlantic Wrestling was a huge part of my youth, maybe the biggest.<br \/><br \/>I was at County Hall when the Mid-Atlantic title changed hands. I got to see these true heroes and legends in person. I am reading this great new book, and it brings back so many memories of seeing this belt and the incredible array of talent that carried it. The amount of detail given and the history lesson that Dick shares in this book make it a must-have for any fan of the Mid-Atlantic era. The one line that truly grabbed my heart was “the great era known at Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling had quietly come to an end.”<br \/><br \/> Reading through this rich history and looking at the great pictures allowed this fan to step back in time for a brief moment and relive the glory days of wrestling. Thanks, Dick, for your dedication and detail in this exceptional book. I highly recommend it to any fan of the era when most of those our age fell in love with pro wrestling. I also recommend it to new fans and challenge them to study these greats from the past. May the true legends and icons like Wahoo McDaniel, Paul Jones, Jack Brisco, Roddy Piper, Blackjack Mulligan, Ivan Koloff, Rip Hawk, etc. never be forgotten.","parent_asin":"1075924685","timestamp":1565540298666,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false}

However, the leads quickly grow cold, and Imanishi - and the readers - rely on small strokes of luck (and encounter many dead ends) as the case slowly unfurls.<br \/><br \/>I loved this book for many reasons. The first is the story itself: it has a slow pace, but not a dull or plodding one; almost everything happens for a reason, and all the loose ends are tied up in mostly satisfying ways by the end of the book. In addition, Matsumoto writes about postwar Japan in an intriguing way, and I gobbled up the morsels of Japanese culture he sprinkled along the way. Third, the pacing is excellent, in particular because it illustrates just how gruelling solving a crime can be. I also appreciated the lack of high-speed car chases and big kabooms: Matsumoto doesn't need it to make the plot riveting.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I highly recommend this book to people who like mystery books and for those who want to branch out to international books. I do not recommend it for people who need action at every step.<br \/><br \/>Started: January 11, 2016<br \/>Finished: January 14, 2016<br \/><br \/>Rating: 9\/10","parent_asin":"B003P2WETK","timestamp":1453091018000,"helpful_vote":36,"verified_purchase":true}

This is just another one of those books where the author claims to be radically different than all other chess authors and that this is the greatest book ever. BLAH!

On page 253 he gives short shrift to(11....Bg3+ 12.Kh1 doesn't bother White) when if you omit this move then White long castles next move. Bg3+ immediatly stop the long castle and makes White take more moves to reach his desired position, which is good for Black. This lack of analysis on lines that could be important clearly show the this is a superficial book at best. Only because it has recent games and covers lines where Black does not automatically play 3...e6 does it have any value. The author needs to stick to his books on the great players.

{"rating":4,"title":"The Jordan Tracks","text":"This book is an attention-grabber from the very beginning, which I always like in a book. The story takes place in a small town in Missouri, 1968, during the Vietnam War. We are introduced to Ernie, the main character, when he is a little boy. The scene is a grim one- a scene of the abusive family he grew up in. There is a graphic description of a murder, but it is necessary to set the stage for the rest of the story and to understand Ernie's character. The rest of the book is not graphic at all. Then we fastforward to 1968 when Ernie has grown up and has a family of his own. We learn his son Aaron is fighting in the Vietnam War, and is only a few short months from returning home.<br \/><br \/>There are some great characters in this book. Christa, Ernie's wife and Aaron's mother, is a strong Christian woman who longs to share her faith with her husband. She goes through a long struggle trying to reach him.<br \/><br \/>Fudd and Harley, two of Ernie's best friends and coworkers. Fudd has many hilarious stories to tell at the lunch hour at the plant where they all work, and Harley is a strong, dependable friend whom Ernie and Christa both turn to in their hour of need.<br \/><br \/>I have read about 3\/4 of the book, through chapter 11, and I certainly want to continue! It is different from any book I have read before. Hard to pinpoint exactly why, it's just different. The plot line is easy to follow, the characters made lovable, and the story is very unpredictable. Not to sound too cliche, but, I laughed and I cried. I gasped out loud numerous times. So far, the story paints a beautiful picture of God's love and how circumstances all come together to reach one man.<br \/><br \/>I would not reccomend this book for children under 13, and would encourage parents to screen it first, as it has a few graphic descriptions and \"grown-up\" situations and circumstances that younger children might not understand.

Krebs, of a book with the title<br \/><br \/>Tacitus Germania<br \/><br \/>and the sub-title<br \/><br \/>Fron the Roman Empire to the Third Reich<br \/><br \/>............<br \/><br \/>Background<br \/><br \/> As those who have read some of my more recent reviews know, the structure of a book is important to me. This book has an excellent book structure. This includes a fine table of Contents, which in turn includes a list of Illustrations and a very good Index. It also included an excellent book jacket, which was an immediate help to this reader.<br \/> It was not clear to me initially as to why Krebs's book was \"A Most Dangerous Book.\" For that issue I have gone to considerable trouble to layout the review by myself of Kelb's book, and the review by Kelb of Tacitus's treatise. Hence, the \"Dangerous Book\" is not the book by Krebs, but rather to a book by the Roman historian, Tacitus. Two thousand years ago he wrote a non-flattering book entitled: \"Germania\", about German tribes. Surely he could not have seen that it would be distorted into claiming German superiority and, ultimately  became the perfect tool for Nazi ideology.<br \/> Tacitus described the German people as loyal and strong, but were uncultured, unsophisticated and almost primitive. His book lay dormant until the 15th century. Then a new interpretation started to emerge  that focused on the Germans purity, as well as their strength and loyalty. Over the following 500 years this treatise was reinterpreted, misinterpreted and misfitted to promote political agendas. \"Ultimately, the Germainia was twisted into a statement of the purity of the German blood and a testament of German superiority. \"Adolph Hitler was indebted to it for his racial theories, and Heinrich Himmler, - - - launched a secret campaign to confiscate the manuscript, vowing to resurrect an untainted Germany on its grounds.\"<br \/> This led me to the Index in Kelb's book to search for such words as confiscate or expropriate, but these were not there. However, it was interesting to note the coverage for Hitler and Himmler. It is hard to believe that Himmler had a bit more coverage than Hitler. Why? That is a question that needs answering. In any event this is a most interesting, but complex book. The front cover should have been a warning with two key symbols. The first was crossed olive branches, bracketing the letter A in the title, and representing the Roman period of 2000 years ago. The second was a red Swastika, representing the Nazi regime in the 20th century.<br \/>  Another unique feature of this book was a list of illustrations. Unlike other recent books where I have had to flip pages to find the pictures, here I felt I would not need to do that. Wrong! For some strange reason Krebs did not include the page numbers in this list. Picture numbers yes, page numbers no! A new list with the page numbers, is included below.<br \/><br \/>1. Mosaic, 1855, Introduction, page 16.<br \/>2. Codex Aesines, Introduction, page 18.<br \/>3. Fumerary inscription of Tacitus, Chapter 1, page 31.<br \/>4. Woodcut of Poggio Braccioluni (1380 - 14590, Chapter 2, page 67.<br \/>5. Noah's son, Tuysco, the German primogenitor, Chapter 3, page 103.<br \/>6. Tuisco, the father of all Germans, Chapter 3, page 115.<br \/>7. A Germanic feast, Chapter 4, page 137.<br \/>8. A German farmer, Chapter 6, page 170.<br \/>9. SS Runes, Chapter 6, page 174<br \/>10. The facial angle, Chapter 7, page 192.<br \/>11. Illustration of the cephalic index, Chapter 7, page 193<br \/>12. The Germanic Warrior, Chapter 7, page 205.<br \/>13. Photograph of Heinrich Himmler, Chapter 8, page 236.<br \/>14. Tacitean motto of a Hitler youth manual, Chapter 8, page 239.<br \/><br \/>Major Inputs<br \/>.<br \/> Again this listing seems to give a higher ranking to Himmler vs Hitler. It also leads to some interesting questions and to some new words, which needed interpretation. Examples follow.<br \/><br \/>1. Noah and Noah's son, Tuysco, the German primogenitor.<br \/> First off this Noah was coupled to the Noah of the Arc legend. The author talks of interesting references, as follows.<br \/>(1) In 1498, the \"Commentaries on the Works of Various Authors Discussing Antiquities,\" was published. This was a collection of historical texts thought lost. It included a novel account of the times before and after the \"Flood.\" It also included stories of nations founded by Noah's sons on soil still saturated with rain.<br \/>(2) \"For Germans these rediscovered texts contained sensational information as well.\" They learned they descended from Tuysco.<br \/>(3) However, it turns out that \"the nature of the `Antiquities' as a whole, whose slyly understated title hid what to this day counts as a masterpiece of artful forgery.\"<br \/> This event makes it rather difficult to capture fact from fiction. Wikipedia also starts its report as follows:\"A flood myth or deluge myth is a mythical or religious story of a great flood sent by a deity to destroy civilization as an act of divine retribution.\" This description makes it even more difficult to separate fact from fiction. All of this complexity was particularly disturbing to this writer as I have read the book \"Noah's\" Flood by William Ryan and Walter Pitman. I have also  written on \"Noah's Flood.\" Indeed I was convinced I knew fact from fiction on this subject. I still do, but I concede a need to re-visit this subject.<br \/><br \/>2. The Word of the Day<br \/> This book out shines the Bill O'Reilly show, in introducing new words into my vocabulary. A few examples follow.<br \/>(1) cephalic of or relating to the head; cephalic index (CI) - the ratio of the short and long axis of the fetal cranium.<br \/>(2) codex - a manuscript volume, especially of a classic work or of the Scriptures.<br \/>(3) ethnography - the branch of anthropology that deals with the scientific description of specific human cultures.<br \/>(4) portentous - ominous; portending evil. marvelous; prodigious; wonderful.<br \/>(5) The Völkisch movement is the German interpretation of the populist movement, with a romantic focus on folklore. This movement was not unified, but a cauldron of beliefs, fears and hopes. It was arguably the largest group in the Conservative Revolutionary movement in Germany. However, like \"conservative- revolutionary\" or  \"fascist\" völkisch is a complex term<br \/><br \/>3. SS Runes<br \/> The picture of the SSRunes is the cover of Photo Album B in the Himmler Collection. It appears to represent a flag, with a large circle enclosing four rectangles. These are shown as two sets, with each set having the two rectangles joined. It might be a precursor of the Swastika.<br \/> A Google search for \"SS runes\" provided many interesting replies, with one entitled: \"Norse Rune Symbols and the Third Reich\" the most interesting.<br \/> The book also had much to say on this subject, stating with Copenhagen, where Germany and Scandinavia meet. The writer mentions several people, several books and much commentary on whether Denmark or Germany was the true cradle of greatness.<br \/> The subject of Nordic myths was also reviewed and \"provided subject matter for rune stones.\" - - - \"The runic letters -- use of which was stitched and printed on millions of lapels and and documents, would come to symbolize the terror spread in the Third Reich.\"<br \/><br \/>4. Heinrich Himmler.<br \/> Chapter 8 has much to say about HH. And the title of Chapter8, namely: \"A Bible for National Socialists\" begs that this chapter be investigated.<br \/> The initial paragraph begins with \"A Foreign Correspondent noted the `breathless silence' in the in the mighty room.\" The cardinal-archbishop of Munich and Friesing--in giving his New Years Eve address, on December 31st 1933--held the attention of the numerois journalists from around the world, but also the many members of the newly installed National Socialist Regime.\" These grave diggers for the Weimer Republic were not yet certain of their power and the cardinal made them nervous. On the preceding Sundays<br \/>of Advent his sermons were heard in three churches, filled to the last seat. These sermons covered inappropriate issues. One of these was that the National Socialist program contained an article that decried the Old Testament as an offense against the \"moral sense and the sense of decency of the Germanic race,\" he had spoken about its value. He was surely careful to qualify his statements, but he should have foreseen  that in praising the people of Israel for having `exhibited the noblest of religious values' he would outrage some and comfort many others.\" One German Jew wrote that he hoped that \"God would strengthen his wonderful courage.\" The cardinal showed courage again in his fifth sermon that NY's Eve. He would need  more for many weeks thereafter.<br \/> The cardinal-archbishop worried that there was \"a movement afoot to establish a Nordic or Germanic religion.\" The value of Christianity was being cast into question. Kelb noted the cardinal painted a picture of the Germanic character, prior to Christianity. It was an \"abhorent picture of polytheism, human sacrifice and `savage superstition'.\" The list of faults was very long. The Germanic nature, the cardinal concluded, owed its civilization and very existence to Christianity.<br \/> This New Years Eve sermon triggered the \"National Socialists of all ages and ranks refuted, scorned and attacked the address - - -.\" It was a \"political crime\" they said, and its speaker, the Cardinal, \"a categorical and determined enemy of the National Socialist state.\"<br \/><br \/> The second sub-chapter was entitled \"The Germanic Revolution.\" It noted that the \"National Socialist political machine was a system of envy and suspicion, fueled by a shared desire for power, and maintained by the seemingly `weak dictator' Adolf Hitler.\"<br \/><br \/> The third sub-chapter was entitled \"Blood and Soil.\" This started with a telling quote: \"The purity of  German blood is the prerequisite for the survival of the German people.\" This quote was from - Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor - 1935.<br \/><br \/> The final sub-chapter was entitled \"Mission Unaccomplished: The Reichsführer and His SS.\" Heinrich Luitpold Himmler read Tacitus on a train ride in 1924. He still had a long way to go before he would become the leader of the SS. Himler had borrowed a copy of this memoir and lost himself in \"the glorious image of the loftiness, purity and nobleness of our ancestors.\"<br \/> Hitler appointed Himler as head of the SS in 1929. Under his leadership the SS grew from 270 to a highly tuned machine of 50,000. While Hitler viewed this troop as his personal bodyguard, Himmler viewed his SS as the vanguard of the grest Germanic empire. His SS should form \"the basis on which the next generation can make history.\" In its Fascist uniforms it presrnted itself as an elite. His SS persued the selection and breeding of a pure Nordic race as its \"irremovable overall aim.\"<br \/> When Himmler learned there was an old manuscript of the \"Germania\" in Italy he ordered his SS to investigate. There were also far-reaching expeditions to Sweden, to the Middle East, to the Himalayas and other searches. Himmler stayed on the alert to get his coveted manuscript, and when Mussolini was overthrown in 1943, he sent troopers to search the Villa Fontedàmo, but the coveted Codex remained out of reach.<br \/><br \/>Conclusions<br \/> After WWII an Italian Count put the Codex Aesinas in a safe deposit box in the Banco de Sicilia in Florence. When the Arno river flooded in 1966 the Codex was one of many damaged objects of art. It was taken to the monastery of Santa Maria di Grottaferratta near Rome, \"where monks skilled in handling manuscripts inserted absorbent paper.\" Their efforts were a success and this manuscript was returned to Florence, damaged, but not destroyed.  .<br \/> In the introduction I wondered why Himmler had more coverage than Hitler in this book. The answer is that this is a book about the mentality of the Germans belief of a pure and superior Nordic race, and Himmler was the architect of this goal.","parent_asin":"0393062651","timestamp":1327580769000,"helpful_vote":9,"verified_purchase":true}

{"rating":5,"title":"\"Profound Character Transformation through Crisis\"","text":"Rosaria's autobiographic story of her journey into Christian faith is a riveting tale of ordinary Christians who live their lives to glorify God and follow His command to go into all the world and be His witnesses.  It's an on-the-spot revelation of how the Lord works through people who understand that no one is beyond the reach of God's saving grace and who are willing to spend their lives sharing their beliefs with the most unlikely \"candidates\" for salvation.<br \/><br \/>Rosaria's story opens a window that reveals faith and worship in action by members of the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America as they reach out to a woman who declared herself lesbian at age 28.  At the age of 36 she was one of the few tenured women at Syracuse University and a community activist.  She was involved in a lesbian relationship and served as coordinator for a gay and lesbian advocacy group.<br \/><br \/>Today Rosaria is the wife of a pastor in the Reformed Presbyterian Church and a mother who joyfully and creatively homeschooled her four children. Only Jesus Christ could have engineered such a complete transformation in her life.  Hers is an inspiring, incredible story and one that is well written from a literary standpoint. Lest the reader be tempted to put her on a pedestal, she openly shares her sometimes busy, chaotic life as she cared for her children, their friends and her husband.  We know she's \"real\" when she writes that she has been known to clean out their minivan which her husband christened the Traveling Garbage Can by sending in her trusted Golden Retriever Sally, to \"fetch old PB&J sandwiches, juice boxes, and pizza crusts.\"<br \/><br \/>If you are a follower of Jesus Christ, you will read this rescue story and rejoice in Rosaria's new life in Him.","parent_asin":"1884527388","timestamp":1375755497000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false}
{"rating":2,"title":"Not bad","text":"The usual mountonus hooligan book \"Grew up in the 70s, tough working class town, salt of the earth, mods, skinheads etc etc became a hooligan\" However told with a lot more honesty than most of the recently published rubbish.<br \/><br \/>First of all, Marsh doesn't even attempt to come across as a pleasant character but rather a small minded racist thug (Reference to black people as \"darkies\" Asians as \"Bombay Bad-Boys\" Driving their \"Quickie Mart-Mobile\") Who runs with fellow small minded thugs who spend most of their spare time attacking rival fans (Hooligans or otherwise he openly admits to attacking normal fans) Club bouncers, left wing protesters, taxi drivers pretty much anyone he meets. He openly admits to carrying Stanley knives and other assorted weapons and using them at will.<br \/><br \/>The book is filled with the usual travels across the country, fights with rival fans, robberies in London, Birmingham and Wales, trashing pubs and in general just being a prat really. Like most hooligan books he is now a 30 something still \"Doing the business\" But leaving the carrying of weapons to the \"Younger lads\" as the prison sentences are just not worth it. He sets up fake BNP meetings across South Wales (For a laugh) Goes on the run from the police and generally spends most of the book stabbing, bottling and stamping on peoples heads.<br \/><br \/>I heard the author is now big in the English Defense League (Even though he is Welsh and spends most of the book attacking the \"English\" and how proud he is of being Welsh) Considering the EDL are supposed to be non racist I wonder if any of those handful of EDL Black supporters have read this book (I am sure they will be impressed with Marsh's attacking \"Darkies\" in London with roadside traffic furniture)","parent_asin":"0955663008","timestamp":1256156451000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

He cleared up so many questions that I had following the first book and also explained some things I didn't know that I didn't know (if that makes sense). The many amazing stories of his fellow soldier's valor and heroism were awe inspiring and heartbreaking and I thank God that we have such brave men serving our country.  I loved hearing more stories about his friend Jon Tumilson and the amazing man and warrior that JT was, and I also thought the chapter by Amy and all the wives was very sweet and a poignant reminder of the many sacrifices that our military families make.  I'm hoping that hearing these incredible stories of bravery will inspire everyone to do all we can to give back to our troops and their families since we owe them so much. Thanks so much to Marcus Luttrell for writing this wonderful book and may God bless him, his family and all those who served and continue to serve with valor.","parent_asin":"0316185361","timestamp":1336704176000,"helpful_vote":82,"verified_purchase":true}

{"rating":4,"title":"Babysitting in the Loire Valley","text":"Linda lead the life I would have wanted to live in my teen years (minus the au pair taking care of children).  I always wanted to be a flight attendant and live abroad.  I was too short on the flight attendant part and I was never going to babysit anyone's children on a full time basis.<br \/><br \/>It all started when author Linda wanted to work for the airlines.  Finding out that she needed to speak another language she decided that she would be an au pair in France and learn the language so that she could fly to France.  The part of the program that she did not take into account was that she would need to speak French.  The author had a French speaker complete her application.<br \/><br \/>All was well until she met the family that she was going to work for an au pair for...or more specifically the madame of the house.  Of course it is understandable that Madame was upset that that Linda did not speak French.  But given she was about 8 months pregnant she decided to keep Linda.  All was downhill from here.  While every story has two sides, Madame comes across as the meanest crankiest person one could be stuck working for in a foreign country where one did not speak the language.  When Linda takes ill with the flu Madame gives her barely a moment to get better warning her that she had better not infect the household.  While Linda was expected to do light house work she found herself beating carpets and serving guests.  Of course no visit to France would be complete without a married man hitting on you (it was one of the guests).  My favourite was when Linda complained that there was no heat in her room and she was told to send home for warmer clothing.<br \/><br \/>To her credit Linda tries to make the best of the situation despite all the challenges.  Madame's daughter is a mini Madame, snarky and undermining Linda.  The young boy is a delight to spend time with and Linda enjoys baking and making him pancakes.<br \/><br \/>Trying to learn French Linda takes classes at a university in a nearby town.  Here she meets some college kids and finds herself a cute boyfriend.  Interacting with other English speaker and young people her age gives her some sanity.<br \/><br \/>After months of torture Linda makes a decision to quit.  Once again Madame's true colours come out as she kicks Linda out of the house.<br \/><br \/>I give Linda credit for trying to make the best of a situation.  Along the way she is able to experience some of the treasures of France.

{"rating":5,"title":"Conversion, Confession, Challenge...","text":"The ease with which we talk about 'accepting Christ' belies the real challenges associated with conversion...loss of community, confusion about identity, unclear terminology, lack of full embrace and acceptance into the Christian community....the list could go on an on.  Dr. Butterfield explores her lived experiences related to becoming a believer.<br \/><br \/>On another level, this book is about knowing and thinking.  Butterfield noted:  &#34;Christians always seemed like bad thinkers to me. . . . seemed like bad readers. . . . [bringing] the Bible into a conversation to stop the conversation, not deepen it&#34; (p. 4).  I quite enjoyed her discussion of teaching\/the classroom in the 2nd chapter.  She proposed 3 life lessons:  1)  When you don't know what to do, go back to the basics; 2)  Speak the truth, because you never know who is listening; and 3)  It's better to be wrong on an important subject than right on a trivial one, as long as you are willing to learn from your mistakes. (pp. 45-47).<br \/><br \/>I walked away from this thinking a great deal about conversion, safe spaces for people to connect and simply be, the challenges of conversion, and the goofy things Christians say that simply aren't that useful or helpful (smile).  I'm still reflecting deeply on the author's thoughts on knowing and hermeneutics.<br \/><br \/>Who should read this book?

{"rating":5,"title":"A Graceful Air-Brush of Literary Panache, with Warmth, Redemption, Sex, and Soul Wash","text":"Delinsky's writing style unfailingly provides immediate, engrossing reading.  This unique novel continued that legacy.  The first paragraphs of the prologue warmed me into the book, and I looked forward to each parenthesis in time during which I'd be able to return to the read.<br \/><br \/>Before I began reading LOOKING FOR PEYTON PLACE, I was confused about where to place the fulcrum between what appeared to be a balance of autobiography & fiction.  A quick check of the title page showed that the book was categorized as fiction.  Reading into the prologue, I was able to discriminate how the deceased Grace Metalious was woven through Annie Bank's reality (this novel's fictional character), as opposed to being woven through Barbara Delinsky's reality.  Part of the confusion (and the appeal) had to do with Delinsky's photo on the hardcover book jacket relating uncannily to the one of Grace, and to the artistic representation of Annie.<br \/><br \/>The reality Vs. fiction questions played out as a unique type of intrigue, which continued percolating even after I had settled into accepting the story as fiction.  I couldn't help speculating how Annie's feelings and actions might have been lifted from Barbara's younger life\/career, and blended into her current seasoning as an author.  Contemplating Annie and Barbara's similarities and differences added to the story's charisma.  I, and probably many other readers, was also mesmerized by a First Person Narrative of a writer dramatizing how she thinks through, and goes about writing a book.<br \/><br \/>Throughout this plot, Annie was repeatedly asked (in essence), \"Are you going to write our shames and shambles into a book?\"  The interjections of that question, posed in various words and ways, continued to feed my curiosity about \"would she\" ... or, \"did she\" write that book (in this one).  I imagine that this draw of curiosity was Delinsky's intent, which, in my case, worked.<br \/><br \/>Parallel situations from my life to Annie's also worked to enhance my enjoyment of this exquisitely designed plot and writing style, which was subtly and sensually different from any of Delinsky's other novels.  Yet, initially (my reason for avoiding reading this novel sooner) I was put off by the environmental ploy of mercury poisoning of local residents by a small town mill.  My life has run a course on a somewhat reverse-flip of good\/evil of Delinsky's redeemed Norman Rockwell photo of small town life in Middle River, presented as a parallel to \"Peyton Place,\" as the 50's novel was re-vamped, modernized, and cleaned up in Delinsky's \"upgrade.\"<br \/><br \/>My husband has worked his lifetime in coal mines.  We are loyal friends of industry, and have been blessed to be repeatedly employed by what we see as heroic \"good guys\" in charge of and in ownership of the several mines at which Tom has worked.  It was very rare that anyone we knew came anywhere near the type of villainy dramatized through Sandy and Aidan Meade; most of our cohorts in the industry were of the James Meade character type.<br \/><br \/>As I continued into the story, with the welcome background of having reviewed many previous Delinsky novels, I was hoping for this one to have applied this author's honed talent of accurately separating good from evil, in the currently slimed (by media and terrorism) industrial arenas of milling and mining.  Delinsky accomplished more than I would have thought possible, given our pervasive cultural climate of anti-capitalism, anti-industry; she successfully exposed how easy it can be to hurriedly mark something as evil, then blindly bully through a  lumped-together package, with no motivation or effort to discriminate nuances, to accurately focus boarders between light and dark, value and corruption.<br \/><br \/>What held my reading most strongly, though, was the easy flowing, colloquial-narrative-style, enhanced by the bright duality of \"voice\" of Grace Metalious communicating with Annie from \"beyond the grave.\"<br \/><br \/>This novel was a courageous evolution of not only Barbara Delinsky's writing talent and natural psychological wisdom; it was a courageous exposure of what appeared to be Barbara's (as well as Annie's) personal foibles given with endearing self-awareness of personality flaws and sparks.<br \/><br \/>I'm speculating that LOOKING FOR PEYTON PLACE may be too solid of a literary offering to be recognized widely and immediately for its subtle glamor in nuance of worth.  This is a slow-simmer winner.  Some of the rest of Delinsky's fine repertoire might fade slightly over millenniums of time.  This one, though, could slide through each barrier between alternate ages and endure, mostly because it's a warm, unadulterated look into the mind of a healthy author (Barbara Delinsky), accompanied by the tortured but redeemed soul of yet another author (Grace Metalious) who was ahead of her time and fell into sorrow and separation instead of rising with her contribution to literary annals.<br \/><br \/>I'm almost chilled with an enormous sense of loss, when I think that this novel might not have been written or published exactly as is.  Prior to reading this novel, I wouldn't have believed I could enjoy it as I did, and come away healed in the areas the story addressed.  Whatever a reader's reservations are about being enthusiastically entertained by this novel, he should set them aside and dive in.<br \/><br \/>Yet, I'm haunted by the awareness that in reality and with real people it's not this easy (and it wasn't easy at all in the novel!) to separate good from evil in business and industry (or anywhere).  It's too commonly automatic to allow anger, spite, and past wounds to run the shows and pursuits in life, as I believe is too often the case with environmental terrorism, possibly any type of terrorism, and with many causes which become so heated by pseudo self-righteousness, and compulsions to act as avenging (dark) angels, that evil begets evil, in the name of good.  The result is that innocent, hard working people suffer most from the heart-wrenching rabble left from rousers (especially from those who've made a career of rousing).<br \/><br \/>In the case of my small town history based on the coal mining industry, our current plight (blight) swirls around a few wealthy new-settlers who retired to our area, combined with (or agitated by) career activists who are not from our area, who do not intend to reside there, yet who desire to rid our area of an industry which is far cleaner than the activists' motives or methods, driven by seething hatred which they \"see\" as self-righteous honor (from my vantage point, it's a sick type of \"honor\" which can be seen clearly only when looking through a glass darkly).<br \/><br \/>My plea to our species is to please be careful, maybe even compassionate, prior to pushing ways and beliefs onto others, especially when that force desecrates a people's history, along with its means of living and surviving.<br \/><br \/>Is jumping to conclusions our greatest habitual evil?<br \/><br \/>Might this be especially so when that (lack of) thought pattern results in acting upon \"facts\" which are not facts, and implementing destructive means to control life, to the ultimate point of human de-evolution?<br \/><br \/>In this novel the author has at least attempted to show how important it can be to take time to gain a true perspective cleared of personal vendettas, prior to methodically working to destroy someone else's way of life or economic structure of well-being.  Sometimes perspective gained means mad motivation lost.<br \/><br \/>Delinsky has my appreciation for what she's accomplished and exposed in LOOKING FOR PEYTON PLACE.  The exposure of which I'm speaking has nothing to do with Mercury poisoning or similar issues (though the alternative cure was interesting).  It has to do with exposing how personal motivations can so easily seat-in to drive causes and cloud issues with a blindly horrifying force for destruction.<br \/><br \/>With those issues attended, I can conclude in good conscience that this was a moving piece of literature, an engrossing, entertaining read laced with an appealingly unique literary style.<br \/><br \/>Speaking of literary style, I should note that novels which use First Person Narrative can be too easily flawed by an irritatingly disruptive reading rhythm, when they're laced with interjected segments of Third Person Narrative.  This novel accomplishes this difficult type of transition from differing points-of-view much better than most I've read.  The narrative style here has light whiffs of similarity to Sue Grafton's \"S\" is for SILENCE and James A. Michener's THE NOVEL (both of which I've reviewed).  My favorite use of narrative style is either an uninterrupted First Person, which has been generally mastered by the detective novel genre as a common choice of narrative.  My personal favorite of that style (used without alternate-view-interjections) has been mastered absolutely by Robert B. Parker in his Spenser series.<br \/><br \/>What Delinsky has done in the First Person segments in this novel has edged beyond mastery, and has exquisitely captured the narrator's personality through her naturally-spiced speech patterns.  The result is that Annie Banks' voice and spirit lives through the words of this story.<br \/><br \/>In an interesting Afterword, the publisher provided a short history of Grace Metalious and PEYTON PLACE, including a summary of that novel's plot, which was helpful to me since I've not read PEYTON PLACE.  Each time I've approached the book I've felt overwhelmed by a sense of artful hollowness.  Yet, I know that Grace was a rare and highly skilled author of uncanny talent.  I know I would drool over the literary luxury in her words.  But I'm rarely in the mood to willingly depress myself, which is why I'm thankful to have read Delinsky's book, including the Acknowledgments and Afterword.<br \/><br \/>I recommend this novel for its reading appeal, as well as its value as an offering of good literature traversing multiple layers, levels, and ages.<br \/><br \/>Linda Shelnutt","parent_asin":"0743246446","timestamp":1169912452000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false}

There was one catch; the family wanted an au pair already fluent in French.<br \/><br \/>Desperate to get to France, Linda let the family believe she met their criteria.  Thus, her first experience meeting the family was a confession that she had come to France under false pretenses.  The family was not happy, but agreed to let her stay.

There was a young girl and a boy, and the mother delivered a baby girl shortly after Linda started with them.<br \/><br \/>Things did not go as well as she had hoped.  While Linda was willing to do whatever was needed, the mother in the family quickly stepped over the line.  She started assigning Linda tasks that were not in the au pair job description, and often had her working at household tasks for up to twelve hours a day.  While she got along well with the son, the daughter was haughty and refused to follow Linda's directions.<br \/><br \/>Things were not all bleak.  Linda went several times a week to a nearby town where she started college classes as another way to learn French.  She met some fellow students, and then Adam, who was a gorgeous man who also seemed interested in her.  These weekly classes quickly became her escape from drudgery.<br \/><br \/>Things went from bad to worse with the mother starting to make demands on Linda's limited free time and making comments about her sexual nature.  When things got to the absolute limit, Linda knew she had to make a change.  Could she change her relationship with her family or would she have to find another way to extend her journey abroad?<br \/><br \/>Kovic-Skow has written an entertaining memoir of her time in France.  It is full of her adventurous nature and the pitfalls that a young person alone in a foreign country can encounter.  This book is recommended for readers who enjoy travel writing and those who like memoirs.","parent_asin":"1457514575","timestamp":1363016308000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":5,"title":"Very informative","text":"I read the translated version (Chinese).  It is a wonderful book and I've learned a lot from it.  I used some of the recommendations on the kids in the nursery where my wife and I volunteer and they worked!<br \/><br \/>Some reviewers mentioned only about the spanking which covers a very small portion of the book.  In any case, I personally don't believe the author meant to tell the parents to beat the crap out of their children.  I think he meant to say that children sometimes need discipline and a little spanking on the [...] or hand might do the trick, especially when dealing with strong willed children, the target of this book.  Take myself for example:  I was a very strong-willed child, my father seldom punished me but, I still remember vividly one incident, even after 40+ years.  When I was about 4-5 years old, once he gave me a slap on my hand when I said some pretty nasty thing to my elder half sister (from my mother side).  I was more in shock than in pain from the slap but, needless to say, I learned the lesson and never made that same mistake again.<br \/><br \/>One of my close relatives spoils their only, also strong-willed, child exactly the same way as described in the book.  The kid is now 27 years old, living with his parents and having problems holding on to a job, again, exactly like what the book describes.<br \/><br \/>Love comes in different forms and kids come with different personalities.  The parents are responsible for figuring out the \"right\" way, spanking or no spanking, to teach their children.  This book merely suggests methods that worked before.<br \/><br \/>On a side not, Dr. Gynthia Ulrich Tobias has authored several books dealing w\/ how to bring up children of different personalities, also very informative.<br \/><br \/>BTW, we DO NOT spank the children in the nursery.","parent_asin":"084236661X","timestamp":1201799357000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":5,"title":"HIGHLY RECOMMEND","text":"Rosaria Champagne was a RADICAL leftist, lesbian professor, scholar and activist. She was grounded in the philosophical and political worldviews of Marx, Freud and Darwin. Christians seemed to be 'bad thinkers' and 'bad readers' to her- anti-intellectual. Rosaria felt like they were sheltered from the world's REAL problems, like poverty, violence, and racism. She felt (and still feels) that often the so-called religious right is full of 'spiritual pride' and 'club Christianity'. While she did not believe in God (and if she ever did she believed He was dead), she believed herself to be a very moral person. She maintained a vegetarian diet (due to the ill treatment of animals) and was deeply concerned about the environment. Rosaria owned two homes with her partner and sported gay rights and pro-abortion bumper stickers on her truck. She was NOT interested in Jesus. But He WAS interested in her. What happens when her life collides with the Savior of the world? Beautiful CHAOS! Her story can be found in the book, \"The Secret Truths of an Unlikely Convert\" by Rosaria Champagne Butterfield<br \/><br \/>I was up until 1:30AM last night reading this book!

{"rating":4,"title":"and Their Times\" is a terrific book for those of us who enjoy looking at ...","text":"&#34;Vienna 1900:Klimt, Schiele, and Their Times&#34; is a terrific book for those of us who enjoy looking at art more than reading about it. I am not an artist or scholar but merely an art lover. I recently visited Vienna where I discovered the Secession Movement. I was astonished.  Instead of exploring the city at large, I spent all of my time looking for examples of the movement, both in museums and around town.  My hope in purchasing this book was that I would have a collection of prints to return to again and again and a historical description of the movement to better understand just what was going on at the time the art and design was being created. This book succeeded.<br \/><br \/> The art prints are absolutely beautiful and the historical photos fascinating. Because I am a visual person I will spend hours and days admiring the art work shown on these prints, and reading understand the history and people behind the Secession Movement. When people ask what I did in Vienna and learn I spent most of my time in museums looking at Secession art and touring the city looking for examples of the architecture (buildings, bridges, railings, doors, etc., etc.) of the movement, they are quite puzzled. Since words do not capture the magnitude of the movement, &#34;Vienna 1900&#34; does the job of explaining my unusual behavior to those unaware of this era of art and design. And, it is such a pleasure to see like-minded peoples' jaws drop and to find friends who are also as moved as I was.<br \/><br \/>My only complaint is the text contains photos of artwork which would be interesting to look at but they are so small you will need a  magnifying glass and a 500 watt bulb. An example is a photo of the Mackintosh Room from the 8th Secession exhibition that is 2 x 2.5 inches which is basically useless. The photo itself is, of course very old, and to print it so small in an art book seems ridiculous and frustrating. I could resort to looking up the photo on the internet, but that is why I bought the book! Thus, the 4 stars - I would have made it 4.75 if that was a choice.<br \/><br \/>I highly recommend this book.","parent_asin":"3775726853","timestamp":1420816317000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true}

Truth be told I kind of like that because it feels like a rarer book in some sense.  Steven is a wonderful story teller, and is able to really highlight the atmosphere well throughout his stories.  Steven uses some of his most memorable hunting stories to explain why he is a hunter and what he loves about it.  If you enjoy a good hunting story like I do, you will love this book.

{"rating":3,"title":"Not Among P.J.'s Best, but Has its Moments","text":"With \"The CEO of the Sofa,\" P.J.

It worked brilliantly in his previous effort, the economics made funny tome \"Eat the Rich.\"  It works less well here.  \"CEO,\" for the most part, focuses on domestic American life, rather than O'Rourke's usual travel writing.  Parts of the book are VERY funny (particularly the first chapter, in which he gives the UN a well deserved bludgeoning).  Other good rants involve modern celebrities and the inane 2000 Presidential campaign.<br \/>Unfortunately, the unifying theme of this work, the author sitting around the house with his family, is patently annoying.  He also throws in some material, like the drunk wine tasting, that very much reads like filler material.  Additionally, some of his pre-September 11th cracks (like the ones about Rudolf Guiliani and Osama Bin Laden) seem short sighted and inappropriate now.  Overall, this book would have been stronger had O'Rourke just bound up a collection of the original articles instead of trying to unify them.","parent_asin":"0871138255","timestamp":1017283849000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":2,"title":"A few flashes of brilliance, but a disappointment overall","text":"The first issue of Primeval: A Journal of the Uncanny, wasn't what I expected. I thought I was getting a magazine featuring horror stories and essays about horror. Primeval's self-description on its website didn't lead me to expect anything different, poetically explaining that it is a publication that examines \"the convergence of contemporary anxiety and ancient impulse.\" Sounds very Lovecraftian, doesn't it? The website also promises that each issue will feature \"fiction and essays exploring horror, the macabre, and that which should not be -- yet is.\" And yet, as much as I enjoy fiction that falls into that vast category known as \"the Weird,\" I found that Primeval offered more incomprehensibility than horror, work that was more odd than Weird.<br \/><br \/>One exception is a reprint of Harlan Ellison's \"Basilisk.\" This story combines modern warfare and ancient mythology to deliver a tale that says more about post-traumatic stress disorder -- a cold, clinical term for a hot mess of anger and terror -- than any documentary possibly could. Lance Corporal Vernon Lestig, while returning from a night patrol in Vietnam, falls into a trail trap and brings a foot down right on top of a couple of poison-tipped punji sticks. He loses consciousness, and awakens in a jungle prison minus a foot and unable to see. He is tortured without mercy and tells everything he knows, but it is not enough:  they keep after him. Finally an interrogator steps up close, grabs Lestig's head by the hair, and leans in to ask another question. Lestig's power is unleashed in that moment, and everyone but he dies in the camp. That doesn't prevent him from being court-martialed when his own comrades catch up to him; but he is ultimately given an honorable discharge. After eleven months in the hospital, in which he regains some of his sight, he heads home to Kansas. From there, things incredibly get even worse for Vern. The publicity from his court martial has made him an enemy to his former hometown. His parents have left, his girlfriend has married another man, and his sister wants to know how he could do this to them, perhaps one of the most wrong-way-round questions in literature. His town drives him to the same mental place that interrogator did. It's vintage Ellison, punching you hard in the gut. And it has stayed timely, all these wars later.<br \/><br \/>An analysis of a Saki story, \"Sredni Vastar,\" follows, entitled \"The Cult of the Holy Polecat-Ferret\" by Mikita Brottman. Brottman is an author, critic, psychoanalyst and professor in the department of Humanistic Studies at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore. All of her learning is brought to bear in this excellent and readable study of the tale. The story itself follows, and it is more pleasurable to read for the insight Brottman has provided.<br \/><br \/>There has been a run on stories about Sarah Winchester and her mystery house in San Jose lately. My guess is that a bunch of authors and scholars took the opportunity of Nebula Weekend last May to visit this 160-room mansion, full of stairways that go nowhere and doors that open on nothing, and concluded that there was something to write about there. Patty Templeton gives a straightforward history of Winchester's life and work in \"The Queer Account of Sarah Winchester and Her Mystery House.\" Templeton is sympathetic to Winchester, suggesting that she is less crazy, fake-psychic-influenced dupe and more canny business woman and amateur architect.<br \/><br \/>Marc D. Ruvolo offers a study of dark heavy metal music in \"Do What Thou Wilt: The Dawn of Satanic Rock.\" Innocent that I was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and having ears that I do not care to assail with heavy metal ever since, I was never aware of the strong current of Satanism, or at least fake Satanism, in rock by such groups as Black Widow, Coven, Black Sabbath and others. Based on Ruvolo's article, I don't think I've missed much, either.<br \/>G. Winston Hyatt interviewed horror writer Jack Ketchum with some insightful questions, and Ketchum answers by giving us some glimpses into his creative process. I was surprised to learn that this man who has written of such dark spots in the human psyche believes that mostly he is writing about love.<br \/><br \/>Creative people often sound -- well, sort of crazy when they talk about their theories of creativity.  Adam Rose sounds like he's gone completely around the bend in \"Antibody Corporation: The Law of Research.\" I found this piece pretentious with its faux mysticism. Consider, for instance: \"Those who regard power and money as evils will surely be denied their freedom, and those who avoid technology will become as machines. Reality is the new occult. It's time to decide what kind of demon you will become.\" It gets worse from there.<br \/><br \/>The last piece was what I'd been looking forward to the most: a new story by Laird Barron, \"Nemesis.\" But I found this story muddled, confused and confusing. The point of view switches frequently, as does the voice in which the story is told (starting from a second-person voice, directed to \"you,\" changing to first person after a few paragraphs and to third person a few paragraphs after that). The \"history\" being related in the story changes, too, as a goldfish is alive and then dead and then alive again; there are multiple stories of how a boy lost an eye; and conversations seem to float all over the place, making it almost impossible to tell who is speaking. Barron has been experimenting with his fiction, but this experiment got away from him.<br \/><br \/>Editor G. Winston Hyatt wants to do something new and different with this journal, mixing up criticism and scholarship of all kinds of arts with manifestos of artists with art of all sorts, with the only commonality being the dedication to the uncanny. This first issue of the magazine started out strong, and has a few flashes of brilliance, but it traveled so far into such oddity and, ultimately, inanity that it lost me.","parent_asin":"1940250064","timestamp":1380560709000,"helpful_vote":7,"verified_purchase":true}

This is a hot topic that doesn’t get much press or validation with current social biases. trends, and beliefs. However, Butterfield’s journey to faith is compelling.<br \/><br \/>A pastor, without judgment or condemnation, is the authentic messenger who speaks life to this woman on the opposite spectrum as he. He becomes salt and light to her by engaging in dialogue with this educated, active, professor, lesbian, and social activist.<br \/><br \/>Butterfield’s story, a unique one at that, unfolds her remarkable spiritual awakening, from that of a homosexual in identity, leader, and lifestyle, to her spiritual conversion, then Christian marriage and her role as pastor’s wife, leader, and mother.<br \/><br \/>Her strength and clarity of thought are her friends as she enters the fray, a fascinating road upon which she travels to discover truth for herself. I applaud her courage in speaking her faith story.  Her exit from the gay community where she felt safest and wanted was difficult. Her professional area of study was at cross-purposes with her awakening faith. It was costly. She lost community.  And she gained community. Truly, God works in mysterious ways.","parent_asin":"1884527388","timestamp":1564441689174,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false}

Ironically, the first time we ordered it (from a bookstore) - the wrong book was delivered. Little did we know how closely we would identify with the story!  Cleo’s character was almost a little too relatable at times. She has the bravery and determination to do what no one in her world has done, yet can’t resist curling up and listening to someone read her a good story. As for the plot, it was perfectly paced. It moves quickly, never letting the reader get bored, but pauses every so often to let you get a better sense of the world Cleo is living in. However, some of the most foundational assumptions made by the reader are proven wrong in world-shattering plot twists. The kind of plot twists that completely change your view on the entire story. My recommendation is to get your hands on a copy of Cleo Porter and the Body Electric IMMEDIATELY. Or try Greetings from Witness Protection!, The Right Hook of Devin Velma, or The Tornado, all other books by Jake Burt.

He spent many, many hours with her and became her friend. Others also mentored her. She details her conversion, her lengthy repentance, followed by her sanctification and public worship. The final chapter is as amazing as the rest of the book. She marries a pastor, they adopt four black children whom she home schools. This chapter will be of interest to all home school parents.

{"rating":3,"title":"Love\/hate this book!","text":"OK - for the first few reads, I LOVED &#34;Can You Buy Me the Wind?&#34; ... First, it's a NY Times Bestseller.  That always gets me.  Second, it has TWO wonderful lessons in it.  The first lesson is about working for stuff (Sammy's grandparent's arrive, gift-free, and she has to earn her kite - piece by piece - before she gets it).  The second lesson is that sometimes hard work by itself isn't enough - sometimes, when we want good to happen to US - we must GIVE to OTHERS.  This is all great!  Where it goes wrong? When they come, Sammy wonders what she wants, and every toy imaginable is pictured as she imagines her earned item. Sammy cleans her bedroom, playroom and garage, earning the kite, the wood and the sting.  So what happens when she goes to fly the kite?  Oh right - well, the &#34;grandparents&#34; have these pretty deranged\/pleased looks on their face as they tell Sammy that they're sorry - you can't buy the wind.  After 4 reads I wondered why was the book not ended when Sammy earned her kite?  No - she works hard for it - only to find out that &#34;sometimes hard work on it's own is not enough&#34;  - a lesson, I believe, that is for a different aged child.  Someone older, someone who can learn to live with disappointment - EARLY - when they put their all into something and &#34;it doesn't work.&#34;  Isn't the first lesson &#34;work hard and you will earn things&#34; - yet here Sammy does just this.  Yet it's not enough.  So the grandparents, or Schoenfeld, explain, in a very adult sounding way, that when you want to make the wind blow, the best thing to do is ... to go out and help people?  I get the beauty of the writing and a theme.  But think of what message this gives to our children?  You might work hard for something, but sorry!!  Sometimes other things get in the way.  I just feel this is more of a lesson for older children and should be illustrated as such.  They do NOT ALL &#34;get it.&#34;  And- This is to the illustrator:  It takes me FOREVER to read this book to my twins.  This is because when the Grandparents ask Sammy what she wants, my kids ALL point to something that THEY want.  When they see her bedroom, they like something in there (one twin says it, the other wants something else and then my older son joins in!).  When they see the playroom they love her many pair of boots.  And in the garage, we see multiple bikes ... of course my daughter wants the red one and my son says the blue &#34;is his&#34; - so I'm reading a book about &#34;learning to earn&#34; and &#34;learning to give&#34; and ALL my children say is what they &#34;want&#34; - &#34;I want that&#34; - is repeated throughout as I read.  So, illustrators,  please don't make the adults look so deranged and happy when things don't work out for their children!!  I do have a love\/hate relationship with this book.  I'm really surprised an editor or publisher didn't pick up on this and push for it!  It's a good story, but it has so much disappointment.  I think for kids, things need to look up a little bit more.  It's well written.  It's just that TWO bestsellers would have come of dividing the themes.","parent_asin":"0578152452","timestamp":1463314118000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false}

For the first time in her seven years as director, she has the money to hire additional staff. Maura Beth may be happy with the library's situation, but things aren't looking rosy for Cherico. Shops are closing, which means the taxes to support the town are less. And, Councilman Durden Sparks' dreams of bringing in a factory to the town's industrial park just collapsed. Townspeople are a little suspicious after tips were stolen at The Twinkle. And, some beloved friends are losing battles with their health. &#34;Cherico and many of its citizens were hurting and needed to feel better about themselves as the holiday season approached.&#34;<br \/><br \/>When Maura Beth's mood needs uplifting, she naturally turns to her friends and the library's Cherry Cola Book Club. She doesn't see the town's losses as the death of her beloved small town, as Councilman Sparks does, but she knows everyone can use some Christmas cheer. So, she proposes that the club members meet in December, and bring an uplifting story to share. The citizens of Cherico need to rally to support each other, and their town.<br \/><br \/>Despite the downturn in the town's economy, Ashton Lee's latest book has an optimistic, hopeful tone. It's a feel-good, reflective novel, more so even than the other books in the series. Once again, Lee gathers his appealing characters to support their beloved small Southern town. The stories told by the members of the Cherry Cola Book Club are inspirational, reminding readers how far the characters have come in their lives. The story is warm and comforting, just what a Christmas tale should be. And, it's filled with the atmospheric touches that make this Mississippi small town come to life.<br \/><br \/>When you have time to settle in for a Christmas comfort read, don't hesitate to reach for the A Cherry Cola Christmas. It's a warm, comfortable visit with old friends.","parent_asin":"1617733431","timestamp":1445645047000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false}

I am sure she will be judged harshly for loving her Lord to the point of obeying him, but I suspect that is the whole point about following Christ anyway.<br \/><br \/>I appreciate most Mrs. Butterfield's honesty about her frustrations as she encounters the petty foibles of fellow believers, and her own weaknesses.  There is much insight and wisdom in these pages.<br \/><br \/>My only quibble is with the book's emphasis on a narrow slice of Christianity known as Reformed Presbyterianism. Not that I have anything against these folks.  It's interesting. I just fear that for the average reader, it may be a barrier to grasping her greater themes.

{"rating":3,"title":"Meat Eater","text":"Adventures From the Life of an American Hunter<br \/>By Steven Rinella<br \/>The Random House Publishing Group, 231 pgs<br \/>978-0-385-52981-5<br \/>Rating: 3.5<br \/><br \/>Steven Rinella's explanation of why he hunts is, drum roll, he was hungry. He says \"there is no time for emotional dawdling,\" but instead for \"unerring judgment...speed, precision and discipline...time to do what millions of years' worth of evolution built us to do. And in the act of doing it, you experience the unconfused purity of being a human predator, stripped of everything that is non-essential. In that moment of impending violence, you are gifted a beautiful glimpse of life.\" Hmmmm...I thought he was just hungry.<br \/><br \/>Meat Eater is the story of how Steve Rinella developed into the outdoorsman he is today. It is the story of a boy who began fishing at three, shot his first squirrel at eight and his first deer at thirteen. At the age of ten he aspired to be a mountain man and fur trapper. He tells the story of his ultimate disillusionment with trapping, particularly snare traps. He even chose the colleges he would attend based on their locations in relation to hunting and fishing opportunities. He is now married and a father, living with his family in Brooklyn, New York. Yes, Brooklyn. But he and his brothers own a cabin in Alaska so it's all good.<br \/><br \/>My favorite chapter is the one about an expedition for Dall sheep in Alaska. The author and his brothers spent several days camping and scouting for the sheep. Rinella goes into detail about the strategy and tactics involved, the habits of the sheep and biological characteristics. This is the only hunt that he describes as \"trophy hunting,\" seeing as how they might not be able to pack the meat out in time before it began to rot. Rinella acknowledges the controversy inherent in trophy hunting: he wanted the skull to decorate his home. So, do with that what you will. I don't usually like the idea of trophy hunting but, as described in this chapter, predator and prey seemed fairly well-matched.<br \/><br \/>Also, the author holds a special ire for catch-and-release fishing. He seems to regard it as moronic. Rinella only practiced it for approximately a year because: \"Just to be clear, catch-and-release fishing amounts to poking a hole into a fish's face and exhausting it, then letting it go because you don't want to hurt it.\"<br \/><br \/>There is an essay at the end of each chapter called \"Tasting Notes.\" We found out how to cook, and how not to cook: squirrel (grill after marinating in a Jamie Oliver recipe); beaver (what appears to be a rump roast in a Crock pot - tastes like beef, or you can eat the tail which is all fat and gristle);deer heart (slice like a bell pepper, dredge in flour and fry on the stove top); jerky (dried in a contraption built of stuff laying around the garage that sounds like found art); black bear (bear meat tastes like whatever they've been eating, also render the fat and use it for cooking); salmon (dipped raw in a mixture of soy sauce and tubed wasabi); and mountain lion (barbecue and chip it.)<br \/><br \/>I myself have few reservations about hunting. My father's side of the family have always been hunters and fishers. I have spent some of the best times of my life with a cane pole and a box of worms, dissecting minnows lakeside at the age of three. I have, in my time, helped my father gut, clean and skin deer. I drove home from school one afternoon to find a deer carcass hanging in the tree over my parking spot. I have eaten venison, dove, quail, rabbit, buffalo, squirrel, frog legs, and enjoyed many a fish fry. I was taught to eat what you kill. So I have no problem with the hunting of prey animals. I do have a problem with hunting the predators. If you take down too many predators you can upset the balance of predator to prey. The prey animals can become overpopulated, get sick or starve. So it was hard for me to take when Mr. Rinella goes hunting for mountain lions, says he's curious how they would taste.<br \/><br \/>Meat Eater was a treat to read. I learned a lot about things I did, and did not, want to know. It is written with humor and a healthy dose of awe and appreciation for the animals. I cannot recommend this to everyone due to personal sensibilities but I heartily recommend Meat Eater for hunters and fishers. I wish my Uncle Chad were still with us. He would have loved this.<br \/><br \/>Mr. Rinella is the author of two other books, American Buffalo: In Search of a Lost Icon and The Scavenger's Guide to Haute Cuisine. He is the host of MeatEater on the Sportsman Channel, formerly of The Wild Within on the Travel Channel, which was nominated for a James Beard Award. For more on the author please see [...].

{"rating":4,"title":"Perfect satire of the ridiculousness of today's society","text":"Jon Methvin is a new-to-me author, and I wasn't sure what to expect when I cracked open Therapy Mammals.<br \/><br \/>Therapy Mammals is a satire on modern times, poking fun at everything and everyone. The writing and the story are brash, snarky, blunt, and ridiculous. The comparison to Patrick Bateman from American Psycho is made, and I can't imagine a more perfect bedmate for the main character and narrator, Tom \"Pisser\" Pistilini. Drugs, murder, sex tapes, shootings, hipsters, invasive chipmunks...you name it, you'll no doubt find a tongue-in-cheek analysis of it and how it applies to society.<br \/><br \/>I enjoyed this story, page for page, and while I didn't laugh out loud, there were many moments I couldn't help but feel an ironic smile stretch my face. Only those who take themselves seriously won't find value in Therapy Mammals.","parent_asin":"194557299X","timestamp":1544899902325,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":5,"title":"A Timely Read","text":"If you need a book that you won’t be able to resist to put down… This one is for you! I was enthralled by this prescient middle grade book as soon as I read the first page. Let alone, the cover is captivating itself.<br \/><br \/>Even though this is set many decades ahead of present time, you can see how realistic the living situation could be if indeed a virus wiped out a majority of the population. I liked that Cleo’s apartment wasn’t completely “tech-ified” but incorporated many elements that would deem futuristic, like distance learning with Mrs. VAIN, her robotic and all-knowing teacher. Mrs. VAIN is the perfect teacher because of how kind, compassionate, and reassuring she is for Cleo. Cleo has many mental breakdowns and Mrs. VAIN was typically there to help her strategize and calm down. Another futuristic aspect I thought was neat was the simulator. Cleo’s dad tries to make a dry grass for a fall-based soccer field and Cleo gets to test it out in the simulator. In this simulator, she can travel anywhere she wants and even meets up with “friends” aka other quarantined kids.<br \/><br \/>What really kept me on the edge is the mayhem that occurs when Cleo escapes her apartment (I won’t share too much). There are drones that fly everywhere to deliver groceries, home goods, medicine, and more, but the elements that Cleo faces made me so nervous for her. It was wonderful to learn more about her as a person when she was trying to complete this dangerous journey, and how the end of the book just riled me up. I wasn’t expecting to cry, but I sure did.","parent_asin":"125023655X","timestamp":1604422103525,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":4,"title":"A refreshing and different memoir.","text":"I've read quite a few memoirs of people retiring and moving to Spain, Italy and Greece but this is something different. Linda tells of when she was twenty-one and working as a medical assistant for a family practice clinic in Seattle. Her real ambition was to be a flight attendant with an International Airline. The only stumbling block was that she needed to be able to speak another language. This is Linda's story of how she went to France to work as an Au Pair to try and 'drop herself in at the deep end' to learn the language as she went along. She wasn't entirely honest with the Dubois family who she went to work for as she told them that she could already speak French. At first, on finding out her deception, they seemed quite tolerant and helped her to enrol in classes to learn the language. Gradually Madame Dubois asks more and more of Linda so that she gets to the point of wondering if she can cope with the job anymore. This book has a great beginning, very easy to get into. It is fast-moving, to the point and Linda's enthusiastic, bubbly personality bursts through the writing. Linda does quite an amount of cooking with Madame and there are some lovely descriptions of the foods in the book which evoke smells and taste. I like how she presents a 'taster' sentence at the beginning of a chapter, hinting at what is going to be happening without giving too much away so you just have to read on to find out. I really enjoyed this, it was nice easy reading with fairly short chapters. It's intriguing, you are kept guessing as Madame Dubois's behaviour is changeable, it must have been very confusing for the young Linda. There's a bit of romance in here too, a lovely varied read. I understand that a follow-up is being written and I look forward to that very much. Great read, I really enjoyed it.","parent_asin":"1457514575","timestamp":1395004405000,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false}

Even within the first few pages, I probably said “wow” and “oof felt that” enough times to fill up a page of my own. There’s poems of different lengths split into four different parts (each representing a significant stage of healing imo) but even in a few short lines, Shelby was able to articulate so many common concepts & feelings amongst humans (such as grief, insecurities, identity, self-love, regret, forgiveness, etc) into words so hauntingly beautiful. I use the word ‘hauntingly’ in the best way possible— so many poems stuck with me, with more pages bookmarked than not. The recurring theme of mirrors, shattering, and reflections is so brilliant & beautifully reflected throughout the book (no pun intended lol).<br \/><br \/>I also really like how there’s some pages with illustrations to visually match the mental image depicted through the captivating words of the poem. It’s hard to put down but I highly recommend taking your time to read & process each poem, especially the ones that resonate with you.<br \/><br \/>I can’t recommend this book enough, especially if you struggle(d) with self-esteem, regrets, and the complexities of mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression, & eating disorders.<br \/><br \/>Thank you, Shelby, for creating such a beautiful masterpiece that resonates so deeply. &lt;3","parent_asin":"1771682760","timestamp":1680696122928,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true}

Ms. Bacon had insight and some courtesy in describing to her readers the details of a Japanese woman's life.

{"rating":5,"title":"Fun and very educational","text":"I had studied electronics on my own as a kid, wanted to be a TV repairman in the 60's & 70's, but made a career in software instead.  Nearing retirement now, I started from scratch with this book after reading the sample in Kindle.  I expected to get incremental gratification from completing each breadboard experiment, but I find I am getting something more valuable than that.  I am getting a sort of gut-feel that had eluded me earlier, for the behavior of components that can be counter-intuitive.  So the journey turns out to be better than the milestones and destination, which is a concept that has rarely been real for me except in travel and backpacking.  My enthusiasm keeps growing.<br \/><br \/>I've spoken with authors of tech books at conferences, and was told book sales rarely pay off except as advertising for the author's speaking and consulting income.  Book prices and relatively small sale volumes don't compensate for the expended hours.  This book and its successor (Make: More Electronics) embody a stunning amount of detail effort and thought, a testament to the enthusiasm Mr. Platt seems to find in tutoring us in electronics, and in the process of learning through experimentation.<br \/><br \/>After reading his descriptions of voltmeter features, I upgraded from my old one to the NeoTech 4000 and I am pleased so far.  I also bought the pre-packaged kit #1 of parts (resistors, capacitors, LEDs etc) from Pro-Tech traders (I think) which gave a good kick-start to my dive into the material.  I will price alternatives for the equivalent kits #2 and #3 before deciding whether to buy them in kit form (very convenient, but pricey) or ordering the parts individually (for which the author offers a wealth of useful help).","parent_asin":"1680450263","timestamp":1550617085175,"helpful_vote":23,"verified_purchase":true}

{"rating":3,"title":"Better than most but still misses the point","text":"I agree with most that the beginning of the book is a good introduction to electronics. After the introduction you will have to supplement this book with many other sources (internet, books, YouTube videos, etc) if you want to understand what is going on.  I enjoyed the first couple of experiments that built on the ones before, but the problem that I have with this book is the same that I have with our educational system (United States).  There is a huge leap between learning theory and applying it.  Definitions are explained well and the images and colors are helpful.  However, in experiments, when you jump from a simple circuit that has you timing the charging of a capacitor, which illustrates the flow of current well, to immediately jumping into the wiring of an oscillator with three transistors, the disconnect becomes apparent.  I spoke to people that have electrical engineering degrees and more than one stated that they still don't quite understand how they work.  I would say that the first part of the book is a good introductory into electronics, but if you are to do more than copy the schematic of the future experiments, as in actually how they can apply to projects you want to build, you better find help from multiple sources.

{"rating":3,"title":"Simantov","text":"Angry Robot releases a wide variety of Science Fiction\/Fantasy\/Weird stuff novels, so it is no surprise that they have opted to publish Simantov by Asaf Ashery. Originally published in Hebrew, the story is part police procedure\/part apocalypse. Mazzy Simantov leads a group of mystical detectives filled with coffee ground and tarot card readers, soothsayers, and clairvoyants, to help with cases the routine police cannot solve. When women start to get kidnapped by angels, they are called in to help solve the case.<br \/><br \/>There are some things that I did not like about the novel, but I wonder if some of it is due more to the translation than the actual original text. Since I am reading a translation, there are some things that could have been treated differently in the original text. I did not like how dismissive the main character is to her husband, Gabby. We are not really told how their relationship had been before the novel, but he is to the place where he is doing things to try to win her affection, and when he gets what little he receives from her, he is grateful and she is dismissive. I don’t know if this is one of the character traits that Ashery wants, but by making her this sort of person in her personal life, it makes me feel like the rest of her roles as a daughter, officer of the law, and hero, seem tainted. There are some ways that this tenseness between husband and wife carries too much weight at the end of the novel. I also do not like that there seems to be a workaround for every situation. Like if someone gets hurt, there’s a spell for that. If some problem is unsolved, there’s a tarot reading for that. For a book that is part police procedural, all of the clues they find are not used much. Instead Ashery uses a “Well it’s because they have mysticism on their side” way of solving the crimes. The actual detective work is very slim because it is easier to solve the puzzles with mysticism.<br \/><br \/>I did not hate this novel though. It was pretty entertaining despite its flaws. Some of the writing (or translating) is a little clunky at times, but I didn’t hate it. I wish I could do half stars because it deserves more than three but less than four. I think I have to round down in this instance, but if I could, I’d give it three and a half stars. Its slightly better than average, but not by too much.<br \/><br \/>I love that Angry Robot published this, and there needs to be more sci-fi\/fantasy in translation. They are a press that always takes risks, and even though this one did not turn out perfect, the door needs to stay open for other books in translation.<br \/><br \/>I received this ARC through Angry Robot and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","parent_asin":"B07VJBC3MF","timestamp":1598620760916,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

Cleo lives with her parents in an apartment in a large apartment building where all of their supplies are delivered via drone and they cannot leave--she has never been outside. All of her experiences outside of their apartment and interactions with friends are via a simulator and both of her parents work from their home. She is preparing for an exam to begin studying to be a surgeon like her mother.<br \/><br \/>When a package of important medicine arrives down their chute, Cleo becomes concerned. It seems to have been wrongly delivered and she is consumed about the patient not receiving their life-saving drugs. Her parents leave her to problem-solve and she opts to escape with the medicine via their chute in order to transport the medication. On her brave adventure, Cleo learns about the workings of the drones and the apartment building. She also makes it outside where she gets to feel grass and sunshine for the first time…<br \/><br \/>I really enjoyed this book!

{"rating":4,"title":"Hunting Evil is a detailed study of the hunt for Nazi war criminals by Guy Walters","text":"In their new book \"Killing the SS\" Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard provide a helpful bibliography on books dealing with Nazi war criminals. One of those books is Hunting Evil by Guy Walters. It rang a bell as I have seen Walters, an eminent British journalist\/historian who often appears on Nazi related documentaries on the History Channel. I decided to read his decade old book Hunting Evil. I am glad I did. The book provides a wealth of information on the fate of leading Nazi criminals following the end of the Third Reich in 1945. Among the criminals whose tracks are traced by Walters are:<br \/>Adolf Eichmann-The notorious Eichmann's trail is followed from Germany to his life in Buenos Aires Argentina where he lived with his wife Vera and his sons. In an exciting story we see how he was kidnapped by agents of Mossad the Israeli secret service and taken to Jerusalem for trial. He was hanged.<br \/>Klaus Barbie-The infamous Butcher of Lyon was eventually captured and sent to prison in France.<br \/>Martin Bormann-He died trying to escape from the Berlin Bunker of Hitler in 1945 despite several myths that he lived through the fall of the Third Reich.<br \/>Josef Mengele-Auschwitz's infamous Doctor of Death escaped to South America and drowned.<br \/>  The fates of several other Nazi fugitives are chronicled. Many of the criminals were employed following the war by the United States, Great Britain, France and even Russia for spying and espionage work. Many of them never were tried or faced punishment for their horrendous crimes against suffering humanity.<br \/>Walters is no fan of Simon Wiesenthal the famed Nazi hunter. The author says Wiesenthal was an inveterate liar and publicity hand prior to his 2005 death.<br \/>The book is chock full of names and tales to tell so it demands the reader's full attention.

{"rating":4,"title":"Interesting and detailed","text":"I didn’t know how this book would work as audio. Seems like it could only be a coffee table book with lots of pictures. I’d never listened to a book about architecture. What kept me going was all the history woven throughout. Being a difficult subject, necessarily including the horrors of slavery, the author does a great job at balancing all these sensitive issues. Trying to stick to the architectural and heritage issues, he also sprinkles in great anecdotes, family histories, and the true brutality of human beings’ inhumanity to each other. Many of the plantations have been lost, many to fire. The only thing that struck me as odd is that the author is constantly surprised that any arsonist would dare burn down some of these structures. He never addresses that the plantation houses were (and are) seen by some as representations of institutionalized racism and a mocking reminded of the evils of slavery. Other than that, it was a very detailed and fascinating ride through history. Note to the narrator: Great job recording this book, but the sound quality sounded a bit “tinny.” I’m no technician, but it sounds like a quality issue with the studio space or equipment. Glad I listened to this book.

{"rating":5,"title":"A Missing Puzzle Piece for My Research Efforts","text":"I cannot imagine why anyone would want to complain about a book focusing on a single document. Upon first glance, I thought that the book was somewhat choppy in its flow. Howbeit, after I completely focused on the material, I could not stop reading it. As a result, I had to buy a copy of it for myself.<br \/><br \/>This book not only confirms some of the research I have done on this subject, but it gives me more research leads to study. And, it fills in some research gaps. I am thankful for the author's honesty in showing the bias of Tacitus, a Romanized author, in describing the ancient Germans\/ Germanics. I have always been wary of the Roman's view of historical events, and this book explains why.<br \/>[John 16:13 (KJV) Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.]<br \/><br \/>The feeling I had upon finishing my review of this book, before I returned it to my local Library, was very strong: in order to understand the ethnological connection of the ancient Germans\/ Germanics to Noah's son, Japheth, I need to study B.C. sources and various ancient languages. My Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ has given me a tremendous amount of discernment when reviewing documentation, and this book is a great addition to my home library of resources.<br \/>[Ecclesiastes 8:5 (KJV) Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.]<br \/><br \/>Before marriage, I spent 10 years researching Academia for what it truly is, in the form of personal attendance in classes of all types of Colleges and Universities and also working in the Admissions Office as a Student Employee. (Yes, I permanently withdrew from Academia without earning a Baccalaureate Degree. My Jesuit parents forced me into careerism and Academia.)<br \/>[1 Corinthians 12:10 (KJV) To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:]<br \/>[1 Corinthians 12:11 (KJV) But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.]<br \/><br \/>Krebs' book is far superior to spending a semester\/ quarter\/ term at a College or University that only wants to push people through just to keep its Ratings and Affiliations in tact. Classroom instruction is intellectually stifling because it slows down one's learning curve of a subject. Furthermore, Academia is Roman slavery with a modern twist: on one hand, classroom instruction draws out the time necessary to learn a subject. Contrariwise, it speeds you through a subject as a way to say \"you passed\", even though you do not have enough time and freedom to thoroughly study a subject. That is why I am a zealous supporter of both Libraries and Bookstores. And, all of the archaic, ancient languages I have a working knowledge of, comes from countless hours of independent study and research, under the close mentorship of my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.<br \/>[2 Timothy 3:7 (KJV) Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.]<br \/>[Hebrews 4:12 (KJV) For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.]","parent_asin":"0393062651","timestamp":1673544417670,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true}

He was the caring, protective and challenging father figure she needed.<br \/>From mucking out stalls at John Slaughter's suburban stable to leading pack trips into the eastern Sierra, Roni gradually overcame the tragedy of her childhood Her journey was aided by various caring individuals and by the spirits of Paiutes and long gone ancestors.

{"rating":4,"title":"Lawrence for people who can't be bothered to read him","text":"This is not a book about D H Lawrence. It's a book about Geoff Dyer. But all Geoff Dyer's books are about Geoff Dyer. Geoff Dyer likes to write about Geoff Dyer, and he likes to write about Geoff Dyer writing. So this book is about Geoff Dyer writing about not writing about D H Lawrence. It's also a book about how much Geoff Dyer identifies with D H Lawrence, and in the book Geoff Dyer goes out of his way (he even travels to Mexico, Italy and the USA) to show the parallels between himself and D H Lawrence.<br \/><br \/>There are occasional flashes of insight in Out of Sheer Rage, which is largely what keeps the pages turning: it is very much a book about literary heroes, and the process by which a real person - the man, David Herbert Lawrence - is transformed into The English Writer D H Lawrence. It's a book about trying to find the real person behind the image of Lawrence that Dyer has internalized. For example, when Dyer visits Lawrence's lowly birthplace in Eastwood, England, he reflects on the gulf between Lawrence's actual feelings about the place (by all accounts he hated it) and the D H Lawrence Birthplace industry that uses an imagined Lawrence to create a myth of \"English Heritage\":<br \/><br \/>\"It was odd sitting there,\" writes Dyer, \"watching this video about the man who seemed to hate so many things about the town that was now seeking not simply to honor him but to reclaim him as a local author.\"<br \/><br \/>A major theme in the book - and one that is almost overdone - is Dyer's extreme urge to procrastinate, to not get on with his study of D H Lawrence. While this becomes grating at times, it does provide the comedy that helps move the book along in parts. Dyer doesn't seem to be able to get on with anything, which is obviously untrue because he manages to publish copious quantities of books on all sorts of topics, even if many of those books include long digressions on why Dyer doesn't seem to be able to get on with anything. Consider, for example, his reasoning for not being able to get on with settling down in Paris:<br \/><br \/>\"Obviously the way to make myself more settled was to acquire some of the trappings of permanence but there never seemed any point acquiring the aptly named trappings of permanence when in a couple of months I might be moving on, might well be moving on, would almost certainly be moving on... had I acquired the trappings of permanence I might have stayed put but I never acquired any of the trappings of permanence because I knew that the moment these trappings had been acquired I would be seized with a desire to leave.\"<br \/><br \/>For all his insight into Lawrence, into writing and the process of writing and becoming a writer, Dyer seems to have little insight into how irritating he is - he knows he's irritating, but while he writes about why he thinks he's irritating (his incredible indecisiveness and talent for procrastination), he doesn't realize why he's actually irritating, which is because he's incredibly spoiled to the extent of spending chunks of the book whinging like a toddler. Dyer begins his tale in Paris, where he procrastinates indecisively about whether he should move to Rome. The hardship! He moves to Rome, but gets bored there, because it's \"too hot\". He travels to Sicily but he's bored there. Back in Rome, he gets bored and depressed because a local cafe sometimes fails to have his favorite pastry. So he goes to England and buys an apartment there. While grumbling about a local cafe that does not have his favorite doughnut, Dyer toys with the idea of getting an actual job, but decides against it. He also makes trips, apparently on a whim, to Mexico and the USA. But he's bored there and the food is bad. Etc. Etc.<br \/><br \/>The moral of the tale, and Dyer does like his tales to have morals, is that his study of D H Lawrence is a metaphor for keeping busy in life, in not succumbing to the depression to which he appears to succumb with depressing frequency anyway, for keeping going with something even if that something is inconsequential. Is that true? Perhaps, but like Dyer's vast treatises on procrastination it's a trick: Dyer is an accomplished, multiply-published and acclaimed author who is paid to travel to the world's great cities to write books on not writing books about D H Lawrence.","parent_asin":"0312429460","timestamp":1303826802000,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":false}

This book has *no* equations at all and does not refer to other books like Stull's Meteorology for Scientists and Engineers or better Boundary Layer Meteorology. Figure 2.10 at page 14 is incorrect. The author ignored the concepts of surface layer and mixing layer and the resulting equilibrium in the mixed layer where dT \/ dz = -g \/ Cp = -9.75 K \/ km. Also, there is no mention of the rule of thumb that a thermal reaching n x 1000 feet will have a vertical velocity of n knots. This rule of thumb does have a theoretical background. The book Understanding the sky from Dennis Pagen is much better because it introduces some equations where the pilot can assess what is happening.  I would also recommend the book Cross Country Soaring from Reichmann.

{"rating":5,"title":"Very intense installment!","text":"This is the 3rd story in the Darkish Faerie Tale, and just wow, how much happens throughout. We watch Prince Rowan grow as he learns from the Queen, if he is to be King he needs to learn how to be a good King. Tabby also has her learning points. She really goes through an emotional journey in this installment.<br \/><br \/>For me, what I really got was how much one person can love another, what they can and will do for that person to make them happy. One big hurdle for Tabby and Rowan was cohabitating for a week, they needed to make sure they could be comfortable around each other as he goes on to be the King. There are circumstances that prevent them from being a couple, won’t go into them as they may spoil parts of the story, but as much as it pained me to read those parts, I can humbly understand their viewpoints. That is another great reason I love reading Candice’s stories, she tells us the why’s and how’s.<br \/><br \/>And being a Candice Blevins story, of course there is kink, oh boy, is there kink. Lots of pain but lots of pleasure as well, very intense and highly erotic.<br \/><br \/>Remember that these installments have to be read in order, I cannot wait for the conclusion.<br \/><br \/>I voluntarily reviewed an advanced copy of this book.","parent_asin":"B07C56BZKL","timestamp":1526142773870,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":5,"title":"Hunting--For Real","text":"Meat Eater does something simple, but amazing: it presents hunting, fishing, and trapping for what they really are: a primal connection to wild creatures through using their bodies to fulfill our most basic needs.<br \/><br \/>Steven Rinella skipped the contorted, snobbish, and apologetic philosophical hogwash that has characterized generations of hunting literature. He skipped the self-indulgent glamor of hunting trophy kill tales. This is not hunting pornography; it's real stories about a real hunter pursuing animals for all the reasons that people actually do that.<br \/><br \/>The book is composed of stories that illustrate these various motivations to hunt. As a child, it was because his dad and brothers did. In college, because he needed food. He went crazy for steelhead and bonefish fishing because it was so damn exciting. He hunted for adventure in the Missouri Breaks, and Dall sheep for the challenge. And always, it was for every one of those reasons--and to satisfy a deep, primal, desire that needs to explanation or apology. And yeah, to get meat.<br \/><br \/>There's another thing about these stories--they're awesome. Really well-written, and full of subtle insight. I read the whole thing within 20 hours of getting the book in my hand. As an avid hunter who spends many winter nights reading about it, I felt, \"finally, someone who thinks about hunting like I do.\"<br \/><br \/>Rinella doesn't shy away from the moral and ethical questions that surround hunting, fishing, and trapping (hereafter I'll refer to them all as \"hunting, because they are). He explores them not in an abstract sense, but from the more credible point of view of his own personal experiences. He doesn't cowardly justify trapping with imaginary ecology (saying that the animals are overpopulated); he speaks of the youthful fantasies of fronteir life that fueled his passion to live as a trapper. He isn't afraid to challenge some hunting practices, or to describe death in its real and vivid detail. He isn't afraid of the emotion that electrifies the hunting experiences; he taps into it and makes the reader remember and relive (if it's a hunter) or understand (for non-hunters) how real it is.<br \/><br \/>That is the book's power: it's the first true hunter\/non-hunter crossover book, that speaks intelligently to both sides and tackles the questions that both sides grapple with. But after all that is said, he stays grounded in the most basic fact: hunting is about food. In that sense, it is as morally unassailable as gardening and gathering.<br \/><br \/>My only problem with the entire book was a factual one, in which Rinella mentions that Africa and the Americas were overrun by Europeans because they were populated by hunter-gatherers. Actually, sub-saharan Africa was not overrun (the people there still have dark skin) precisely because that continent was fully agricultural way before European colonialism--the takeover of forager territory by agriculturalists in Africa had occurred thousands of years earlier by other people from within Africa.<br \/><br \/>That notwithstanding, this is the best narrative or philosophical hunting book I've ever read, and the first I'd recommend to anybody.","parent_asin":"0385529813","timestamp":1346768021000,"helpful_vote":36,"verified_purchase":true}

It's rated a Level 3 book. The story lasts only 18  pages of the book. After the story are great glossaries in English, Spanish, French, and German giving terrific cultural information about the places and customs, such as nicknames, mentioned in the book. There are three black and white photos with drawings of the main characters superimposed on them.<br \/><br \/>Pepe Rey is a detective in Madrid. He's off to take a case in Barcelona. As he's leaving he hears a song that reminds him of his old girlfriend from 1969 when he was 24. (The book was written in 1987.) Who should he meet on the flight but Lola, the old girlfriend? He wants to catch up but she doesn't seem as interested. What business does Lola have in Barcelona?<br \/><br \/>I hadn't read any Pepe Rey books before this one so I don't know if all the endings are like the ending in this book. Perhaps there is a sequel that explains what happened next.<br \/><br \/>There are a few potential issues with the book. Pepe drinks beer and wine. If the students don't pay attention to the publication date, they will probably turn out the story with Pepe being 69 today in 2014. When written, the character is only 42. It mentions that the Barrio Chino has strip-tease clothing stores on the same street as bridal shops.

Winning the game is not what should be ultimately important over everything else.  Sports figures can be heroes, but the best ones are heroes for more than simply winning.  A true \"pro\" realizes winning itself includes a lot of things and this book takes that to heart to be an \"all pro dad.\"<br \/><br \/>The book underlines the responsibility involved here, doing so with a religious focus, but with lessons helpful to all fathers.  Jesus noted that all of God's plan can be whittled down to two commandments.  The book's principles also can -- the fundamental principles of love and leadership.  The book view this through \"God's prospective,\" which after all boils down to what is good and caring.  This also makes sense since a key to God is love, the basis of parenthood.  This all has a universal message.<br \/><br \/>The book provides seven steps to be a good dad. First, you have to know who you are, self-knowledge an important first step to know your strengthens and weaknesses, how you can use them all. Then, determine your purpose, your motive, method, realize you are a [role] model, know what message to send and know who your are living for. The discussion provides various human stories and breaks down each step to ease the journey. The chapters also end with questions to think about.  It is in effect a workbook on being a good dad.<br \/><br \/>It is a pretty good read and hopefully will make people think, helping them to be good dads.

The author takes a down to earth approach on how to be a father but does not use the clinical terms or fancy explanations.  He conveys his message through stories most men will be able to relate.  The author goes through a seven part break down of what a man needs to do as a solid father.  These questions are asked to drive the seven essential steps: Who am I?  What's my purpose?  Why do I do what I do?  How can I better love my family?  What should I model to my children?  What do I need to share with others?  And who or what am I living for?  All of these questions are addressed so men learn, apply and take a proactive approach to their families, something that is lacking in many households in America.  The book is written in such a way that it will keep you interest, many of these types of books don't and your interest is lost before half way through the book.<br \/>I received a free copy of this book from BookSneeze in exchange for my honest review of the book.","parent_asin":"1595555072","timestamp":1337727299000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":5,"title":"Way, WAY Beyond How-To Tips","text":"Wow this little book has a lot of information in it! A lot more than I bargained for, actually. I was interested in doing a little \"urban farming\" in the form of apartment-gardening and helping friends plant food on the unused hill behind their house, maybe starting a compost heap. But this book covers everything from constructing a homemade \"wetland\" for filtering household water, to recycling human waste (see the hilarious section on the Mobile Composting Toilet!), and so much more. It's not just about taking small steps to get yourself off the grid, it covers comprehensive ways to move communities off the grid entirely--which, the book explains, may become necessary in the not-so-distant future. Frank and crisp in style, and completely without condescension or hysteria, the book describes in clear terms what we can expect in the future if our current systems persist, and how to start making our homes and communities sustainable, equitable and autonomous. While I can't see myself putting all of it to use (there is a section on cultivating insects for chicken feed, making me relieved to retreat into vegetarianism), I felt vastly more aware when I'd finished it, in addition to learning a few things I will try.","parent_asin":"0896087808","timestamp":1233647103000,"helpful_vote":18,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":5,"title":"Crisis and faith in a small town","text":"The Jordan Tracks takes us back to the late 1960s which was an era highlighted by almost universal unrest over the war in Vietnam.  The story brings this conflict to the lives of seemingly ordinary people going about their day to day routine.  These events cause great turmoil to the lives of those depicted.  What makes the story come alive for me is that I grew up in a small town in the Midwest and the characters are much like people I used to know.  Woven through the details of the characters is the strong faith of many that allows them to carry on and even reach out to others in the face of terrible situations.<br \/><br \/>It is common today to evaluate people on their net worth or job which, if done, will cause one to miss the people who are the most worth knowing.  In this book, it is the people who are \"ordinary\" who are the most amazing.<br \/><br \/>I urge you to take a trip in history and find out what it is like to live in a small town.  You will learn how things happen in the \"real\" world and that truly great human beings lived there in 1968 and live there today.<br \/><br \/>The Jordan Tracks touched me, caused me to relive a time when I was coming of age and to view that time and the people from my older and hopefully wiser perspective.  I believe this is Steven Wise's best book to date.  I hope you will take the time to find out for yourself.","parent_asin":"1420813609","timestamp":1111357902000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":4,"title":"Challenging, Suprising, Valuable","text":"One of the book's chief values is Butterfield's blunt examination of how the church, and its culture, first appeared to her.  She addresses many of the stereotypes that abundantly churched people (often unintentionally) foster about non-Christians. And she explains how the Body of Christ both failed and reached her as the Spirit began His work in her soul.<br \/><br \/>Hers is the story of coming to Christ, from the perspective of an intellectually accomplished woman who, with great sincerity, believed the tenants of secular feminism. For her, conversion involved the loss of everything: her values, her friendships, her career. Her story can educate us to better serve men and women like her who desperately need, but may not want, the living water of Christ.<br \/><br \/>The thesis of her book, and one that was powerfully convicting to me, is Butterfield's assertion that Christianity is not primarily a culture or lifestyle.<br \/><br \/>Butterfield says of her life prior to conversion:<br \/>\"Here is one of the deepest ways Christianity scared me: the lesbian community was home and home felt safe and secure; the people that I knew the best and cared about were in that community; and, finally, the lesbian community was accepting and welcoming while the Christian community appeared (and too often is) exclusive, judgmental, scornful, and afraid of diversity. What also scared me is that while Christianity seemed like just another worldview. . .Christians claimed that their worldview and all of the attending features that I saw--Republican politics, homeschooling biases, refusal to inoculate children against childhood illnesses, etc.--had God on its side.<br \/><br \/>Christians still scare me when they reduce Christianity to a lifestyle and claim that God is on the side of those who attend to the rules of the lifestyle they have invented or claim to find in the Bible.\"<br \/><br \/>A friend recently emailed me after reading this book: \"I can't even put into words right now how spiritually beneficial it is!\"<br \/><br \/>Yes.","parent_asin":"1884527388","timestamp":1353503464000,"helpful_vote":13,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":4,"title":"All Pro Dad","text":"Are you the type of dad that understands and loves sports? If you are this dad and want a guide to being a good dad, then Mark Merrill's All Pro Dad is the book for you.<br \/><br \/>Merrill takes concepts of fatherhood and principles of \"just being a good dad\" that each man with children need to be aware of, and communicates them in a method that reads like a playbook for any professional sports team. All Pro Dad has a huge sports theme and has lots of quotes from \"professional\" dads like Tony Dungy, Jeb Bush, JB Brown, and Truett Cathy. It is an easy read that takes something very hard and makes it manageable with a few tips and a lot of prayer.<br \/><br \/>Merrill's foundation is built upon two principles he calls Fatherhood Fundamentals. These are: love and leadership. His thoughts are that men that want to be the best dads that they can be will focus on these two fundamentals. This is done through his list of 7M's. You'll have to read the book to learn more about what these are.<br \/><br \/>Here are a few of my favorite quotes from the book.<br \/><br \/>\"We weren't designed to love inanimate objects. Objects are not capable of receiving or giving love; only people are.\"<br \/>\"...love is all about--investing with no expectation of return.\"<br \/>\"Your leadership of your family will grow in direct proportion to the love that you show your family.\"<br \/>\"Patience is choosing to control your emotions rather than letting your emotions control you.\"<br \/>\"We want to believe the myth that all we need is quality time with our kids. But, our kids need quantity time.\"<br \/><br \/>Would I recommend this book? Sure, it's an easy read that gives great advice. Any dad would benefit from it. This is a book review for BookSneeze.com.

{"rating":3,"title":"All Pro Dad","text":"In case any of you are concerned, yes, I realize that I am not, in fact, a dad.  However, I have found that most books geared to dads easily apply to moms, and vice versa (except for the breast feeding sections in the mom books, of course).  I have had a difficult time recently choosing books to read, and I chose this one because it is connected to the All Pro Dad organization, for which Tony Dungy is a spokesperson.  For those who may not be aware, Tony Dungy is a synonym for quality and integrity.<br \/><br \/>This book was not a great fit for me,  but I could see how it would resonate well with a wide group of people, particularly those who are new dads, new to faith, realizing that they need to become more involved fathers, and those who want a pep talk about being a better parent.<br \/><br \/>This book is not a discipline book, it's not a \"follow this script\" sort of book, but it is a coaching sort of book.  It reminds readers that we likely spend a lot of time on things we would not call priorities, while not taking the time to plan how we will be effective parents.  It calls us out on being specific and choosing our actions, not just letting things happen in our family, and then it helps us form a plan and focus on what is important.<br \/><br \/>There are a lot of quotes and personal stories from fathers in the sports world as well as a couple from the business world.  I think this is helpful for those who are feeling isolated or that they are the only ones who are struggling or concerned about being a better dad...finding role models can be useful.<br \/><br \/>My favorite part of the book comes at the end of each chapter, the huddle up section.  These are questions the dad reading is supposed to ask his child(ren).  A lot of these questions call for humility and vulnerability, which sometimes can be challenging for parents when interacting with their kids.  Sometimes we feel like we have to have all the answers, and acting on these questions would make it clear that we don't (although I would argue that life itself also makes that crystal clear).<br \/><br \/>This book didn't go deep enough for me.  It tackled a broad topic and did so in a broad way.  However, it may be a good starter book for people, or a good reminder book for others.<br \/><br \/>I received this book free of charge from the publisher.

{"rating":5,"title":"Great Perspective for Dads - and Moms!","text":"All Pro Dad: Seven Essentials To Be A Hero To Your Kids is an interesting view on what it takes to be a dad. \"'An NFL player becomes an All-Pro by relentlessly focusing on the fundamentals and executing them with sheer determination. The same is true to become an All Pro Dad. This book not only highlights the fundamentals of fatherhood, but also gives dads a winning game plan to do their most important job well.' -Tony Dungy, Super Bowl winning coach and NBC Sports commentator.\" I really enjoyed the format. The author takes the reader through the 7 M's - Makeup, Mind-set, Motive, Method, Model, Message and Master using a sports theme. Quotes and stories from well-known sports figures and businessmen make it interesting. At the end of each chapter there are Huddle Up Questions to ask your children such as \"How do you know I love your Mom?\", \"What is one of your favorite memories with me growing up?\" and \"What is one thing I can do to be more patient?\" I think any dad brave enough to ask those questions will gain invaluable feedback from their kids. One part that stuck out to me are the twelve parenting truths the author includes. A few of my favorites are \"Parenting is 'heartwork.' It's not just about outward obedience; it's about the inward attitude of your child.\" Or, Parenting = relationship + rules. Relationship - rules = rebellion. Rules - relationship = rebellion. And, Parenting is about failing, forgiving, and asking for forgiveness.\" I also really liked that the book addresses how a dad should treat his wife and how that relationship is portrayed is important. Although this is geared towards dads, I as a mom enjoyed it and will be using some of the Huddle Questions to better get to know my kids.

{"rating":4,"title":"All Pro Dad: Recommended Read for Dads","text":"It's not very often that I read books about fatherhood. I typically stick with either general parenting books or books about motherhood. However, I'm so glad I took time to read Mark Merrill's new book, All Pro Dad: 7 Essentials to be a Hero to Your Kids (Thomas Nelson, 2012).<br \/><br \/>The book is definitely written for men. Its illustrations are suited for guys, as is its easy-to-read format. I have to admit, though, that even though it was written for men, I was still able to get a lot out of it as well.<br \/><br \/>Merrill opens the book by talking about two key components of fatherhood: love and leadership. Then, in the remaining seven chapters, he addresses what he believes are the seven things that will help dads exemplify love and leadership in their homes. These seven things are as follows:<br \/><br \/>1. Know Your Makeup<br \/><br \/>2. Know Your Mindset<br \/><br \/>3. Know Your Motive<br \/><br \/>4. Know Your Method<br \/><br \/>5. Know You're a Model<br \/><br \/>6. Know Your Message<br \/><br \/>7. Know Your Master<br \/><br \/>One thing I loved about All Pro Dad was that Merrill was genuine and authentic. He didn't act like he was the perfect father or like he had it all together all the time. As a mom, I know I would much rather learn from someone whom I view as a friend, rather than someone whom I view as a cold, disinterested expert. Merrill certainly spoke to fathers as a friend--someone who wanted to share some of the things he had learned on his own journey through fatherhood.<br \/><br \/>Another thing I loved about the book was that Merrill provided practical ideas. One such idea was on page 168. Merrill and his family, in an effort to serve those around them, went to the grocery story and bought some snacks and hygiene items. Then they made what he called \"manna bags\" to hand out to the homeless in their community.<br \/><br \/>Another  practical idea was to go out with your children on the same day of every month (the child's birthday). For instance, if your child's birthday was on Dec 12th, you would go to dinner with them on the 12th of every month.<br \/><br \/>If you're looking for a gift to buy your husband (or brother or friend), I definitely recommend this book. In fact, I'd even recommend you read it before you give it to them:)<br \/><br \/>Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze®.com book review bloggers program.

So many other books strike a tone that makes me feel hopeless and intimidated, especially because I am not likely to ever have 3 acres of land for a Mother Earth News style homestead.<br \/><br \/>Yet, the condition of the world's economy and the effects of peak oil clearly show that the time to act is now!<br \/><br \/>Scott and Stacy have a style and the content that makes me feel ready to try things like vermicomposting. Yes, it's true that there are only 3.5 pages on vermicomposting in the book and I still have a lot to learn from the references noted in the Toolbox for Sustainable City Living. Yet, the motivation to get up and try it is really important. In fact, I'm planning to buy worms today! :)<br \/><br \/>Also, Scott and Stacy offer workshops called Radical Urban Sustainability Training (R.U.S.T.).

As compared to past works such as The Bachelor's Home Companion or Parliament of Whores, where the hoot-to-page ratio was about 1:3, this one was about 1:75.<br \/>I hate to say it, but P.J.'s getting old.  This book is soaking-wet with dreary essays about how tough it is for him to be married, married with children, etc., mixed -- in sort of a literary slurry -- with unpublished essays and old works from Forbes FYI, Rolling Stone, etc.<br \/>Judging from his writing, married life hasn't been be kind to P.J.'s wit. This is troubling; even Hunter S. Thompson wrote some of his best gonzo work when he was married.<br \/>Moreover, now that he is a Father, P.J. appears to be losing the strong libertarian streak that endeared him to millions of crazy young GOP types (like myself).  In CEO, he engages in a rambling discourse in which he seems to be reversing his age-old position favoring the decriminalization of drugs, particularly marijuana.<br \/>Some of his essays have strength, and I did appreciate his use of the style of Oliver Wendell Holmes' heretofore-forgotten tome The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table ... but, in my opinion, it simply was't enough to save this book.<br \/>If you're a die-hard P.J. fan like myself, buy it -- but if you're looking to this one as an introduction to his work, you will be sorely disappointed.","parent_asin":"0871138255","timestamp":1006899902000,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":5,"title":"A captivating memoir of challenges, adventure and romance.","text":"Linda Kovic-Skow's debut memoir, French Illusions is a captivating, well-crafted, believable story of a twenty-one year-old young woman who, despite not being able to speak French, takes off to become an au pair for a wealthy French family in the Loire Valley of France. I was riveted to this story and once I started reading it, I could not put it down.<br \/>The author takes us through the painstaking process of facing the haughty, overbearing Madame Dubois, the matriarch of the family, immediately setting the tone of the main obstacle and challenge she has to deal with-proving herself and maintaining her job.<br \/>Kovic-Skow's writing is descriptive and engaging as she weaves in details of the culture and environment in a way that brings the reader right into the scene. Interspersing French phrases, she gives the reader the sense of alienation she experiences. The characters are well-developed and multi-dimensional. The conflict and tension between her and Madame Dubois and her children, especially her petulant and disrespectful seven-year-old daughter are palpable and real. This unfair treatment she endures at the hands of her ruthless employer serves to help the reader empathize with her plight as she weaves in her reflections and attempts to work through the demands and lack of respect she encounters. I found myself rooting for her and feeling some relief that Madame Dubois' husband is far more reasonable and compassionate. His accommodation to his wife though does add to the tension. I appreciate how the author presents the light moments and positive, caring people who help her along the way as well as the dark moments.<br \/>Her weekly escape into a nearby town to attend French classes provides adventure and romance. She meets friends her own age and falls in love with a handsome and caring Frenchman. This presents further complications for her as Madame Dubois undermines any attempts for her to have a life outside of her au pair role. She eventually breaks free and leaves the reader cheering for her resolve and courage to move on from her oppressive situation. My only complaint is that I felt it ended too soon with her staying on to finish her semester. I was left with many questions about the rest of her story. But that can be considered a testimony to her ability to hook me into wanting to know more. I am hoping she will do a sequel. A captivating memoir filled with challenges, adventure and romance. I feel like I took a trip to France and lived through her experience.","parent_asin":"1457514575","timestamp":1362590592000,"helpful_vote":22,"verified_purchase":true}
{"rating":4,"title":"Tools every man needs","text":"I recently finished a review copy of \"All Pro Dad\" by Mark Merrill, published by Thomas Nelson. I have to admit, I was hesitant to request this book from BookSneeze. My fears were confirmed. This book is convicting. Mark has taken his years as a speaker, and his time with Family First, to write a guide for us guys. I would recommend this book to fathers of all ages, even those who hope to be a father someday. Be warned however, this is not a book you just read once and put on a shelf. Mark Merrill has thrown the gauntlet down. This book will give every man, father, and husband the tools he needs to become an \"All Pro Dad.\"<br \/> To become an \"All Pro Dad\" Mark starts with two fundamentals, Love and Leadership. I found it fascinating that Mark's years with Family First has given him access to many influential people (celebrities, CEO's, and NFL coaches alike). Mark has interviewed these individuals, teaching us how universal these foundational truths are-- whether in the home, our careers, in the boardroom, or on the football field.<br \/><br \/> Once Mark has his foundation set he devotes the rest of the book to the seven M's. They happen to be: Makeup, Mind-set, Motive, Method, Model, Message, and Master. Mark devotes an entire chapter to each M and it's importance to us as husbands and fathers. I found that some chapters stung, while others soothed. I suppose that means I now know which areas in my life can use improvement. The real question is, \"Will I put the book to its intended purpose, or on a shelf?\"<br \/><br \/> As the old saying goes, the largest room in the world is the room for improvement. This book is a useful tool for anyone looking to improve and become an \"All Pro Dad\".","parent_asin":"1595555072","timestamp":1341970636000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

I found it interesting, though not my favourite type of mystery novel. The rather unemotional writing style, that seems more like a report, was not my favourite, but how much of that comes from the translation is something I will definitely enjoy finding out as soon as my Japanese level gets high enough to read the book in original. All in all, a fun read, that gives some insights into the Japanese culture.<br \/><br \/>The Kindle version could use a thorough spellchecking!

{"rating":4,"title":"Not your typical spy story!","text":"Audio book review. Overall rating clarification 3.5. The Good Spy Dies Twice is a contemporary conspiracy thriller from author Mark Hosack that apart from the flashbacks, places readers in the US, post-2016 election time frame.  It is tense and at times intense. Our main character, Jake Boxer, is not at all the typical lead man readers would expect in this kind of story; rather, he is deeply flawed, which for me is a refreshing break from the stud hero spy guy.<br \/><br \/>Due to some occupational hazards in his former line of work as an investigative reporter, Jake suffers from paranoia – but then, with all that transpires, doesn’t he ultimately have a reason to be paranoid? Jake is an unreliable narrator because the reader can’t be sure if what he’s saying\/feeling\/doing is because he’s paranoid, under the influence of his pain meds, haunted by his nightmares, or being visited by ghosts (real or imagined).  He is mostly operating in a fog, but he also has his moments of clarity, and even brilliance as we come to the big reveal, which surprisingly happens with a fair amount left in the story.<br \/><br \/>The premise is excellent, the characters are interesting and even intriguing, Hosack’s descriptions are detailed and realistic, and the plot is intricate and full of twists and turns and surprises – all elements that kept me listening. Where I struggled was in the details. There are decisions characters make that don’t ring true (especially for survival situations). There are procedures that seem illogical and unrealistic (and even incorrect – land lines that aren’t digital do not need electricity to work), and there are a lot of deus ex machina solutions and resolutions.  YET. . . that story kept my interest piqued.<br \/><br \/>The narration by author Mark Hosack at times slips into a Rod Serling-ish vibe, but it is performed with passion and real emotional investment.  Jake’s fears, paranoia, and anxiety are depicted very well. There is some inconsistency in the voices of other characters (primarily Al, the concierge), but overall, author and narrator Hosack does an admirable job carrying the story and the tension. I did find the pace a little slow at regular speed, but bumping to 1.25x was perfect for me (and probably even adds to the tension ramping up.)  An unexpected aspect to the audio book was the inclusion of some sound effects and musical transitions that sometimes work well (especially towards the end of the story) and other times feel awkward.<br \/><br \/>I listened to The Good Spy Dies Twice while on a road trip, and I have no regrets that I spent my time that way. As is always the case with audio books while driving, the downside is that I can’t retain specific quotes - and there are some good ones - and I don’t have the luxury of being able to flip back pages to do some re-reading to clear-up any confusion.  I’ll be looking forward to book two of the Bullseye Series, The Chaos Agent, hopefully coming later this year.<br \/><br \/>Thank  you to Audiobookworm Promotions for providing me a the audio download in exchange for my honest opinion – the only kind I give.

What if it was about someone powerful and happens to be about your mother-in-law? I think I would run to the police as fast as I could. Elise is ready to do just that when she gets a message that her son has been injured. I bet her adrenaline is pumping as she races to the hospital. At the back of her mind is the thought that she needs to get in touch with the police but right now her son is upmost of importance. Is it a coincidence that her son is injured right as she finds out her mother in-law is in danger?<br \/><br \/>The story is exciting and I rooted for Elise as much as I could. She does have a problem with her faith and I couldn’t wait to see the road Elise will take to gain her faith again. It is no surprise that there is a murder and Elise is right in the middle of the investigation. The police don’t seem overly friendly towards her when they realize she may have been able to prevent a tragedy.<br \/><br \/>The author does an excellent job of educating readers about lip reading and sign language which Elise uses to communicate with her son. I took classes in sign language because I had a child in Sunday School who was deaf. I was determined that the child would not be left out. The first Sunday I started signing as I taught, I saw a big smile come from that  child. I will never forget the moment she signed thank you to me.<br \/><br \/>Now back to the story. Oh yes we have Elise in danger after someone finds out what she knows. I was a bit disappointed when Elise’s son was kidnapped because it was very predictable. What I did like was the sheer determination Elise has to rescue her son and end the threats against her.

That's why I got my first pair of jeans with some money I made babysitting, and since then have never stopped buying them.<br \/><br \/>Lauren Friedman's book is a crash course in how to wear denim jeans, shirts, jackets, vests and accessories to their best advantage. I had no idea there were so many different types of denim, or that you could pair them and wear them in such a wide variety of styles. With artfully drawn illustrations the author takes the reader through dozens of denim looks for every occasion, from dressy styles for work or formal events to the most casual of cutoffs and beach wear. She clearly identifies the types of washes and treatments designers give denim, something a fashion-challenged gal like me found very interesting, and offers several options on how to wear the particular cut or style.<br \/><br \/>In the back pages there is a short history\/timeline of denim that I thought was delightful. I also appreciated the section on how to recycle denim, which provides some ideas on upcycling. Just as an aside, quilters often make heavy-duty quilts out of patchwork made from old denim, which I've always wanted to try -- only I'm too attached to my old jeans to cut them up just yet. My only criticism is the author's recommendation never (or rarely) to wash your denim. It may help preserve the fabric but I'm too much of a clean freak to do that. I also think that the more denim fades, the more attractive it becomes, so that may color my opinion here.<br \/><br \/>Since my daughter is young, hip and much more fashionable than I'll ever be, I asked her to take a look at the book and give me her take on it. Here's what she said:<br \/><br \/>She's not a huge fan of denim (she must get that from her grandmother) but it will always be timeless and popular.<br \/><br \/>The styles are well put together and very trendy.<br \/><br \/>It would have been nice to represent more diverse body types in the illustrations (her only criticism.)<br \/><br \/>50 Ways to Wear Denim is a fun read, and a great way to learn more about the fabric and how fashionably flexible it can be. I recommend this book for the jeans lovers or anyone who wants to get more mileage out of their denim garments.  I received an advanced reading copy of this book in exchange for an honest review from Library Thing's Early Reviewer program.","parent_asin":"1452149992","timestamp":1478260269000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false}

Poor smart people! Saved by the kind, savvy aloof pastor, playing it cool.... Sidenote: If you believe this woman is no longer a lesbian you were not paying attention to the bit in between the lines  or ... well the hope lives on for Christians that homosexuality is curable; maybe she is bi- at least. Hailed as a champion-slash-posterchild of the Christian right, this lesbian intellectual(doubly Satanic!) is held up as proof of God's power to Save even the most pathetically lost souls.  Condescending and brazenly bigoted display of the ugliest side of Christianity: the supreme arrogance to presuppose someone's life is flawed if it is not Christian; there was nothing wrong with this woman before her conversion.  As soon as Christians accept that...well a true Christian cannot.  She admits that \"outside of Christ\" she is the same ambitious jerk she was before: what does such nonsense even mean?  I read this out of curiosity: would it be an honest intellectual exploration of one's own irrational behaviour or just another glorified recruiting tool for Sunday pastors.  Literally preaching to the converted, to add a lame cliché of my own, as no one else is going to be moved by this dangerously vacuous piffle.","parent_asin":"1884527388","timestamp":1384083977000,"helpful_vote":24,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":3,"title":"Great Premise ! Lacks attention to detail","text":"In his book \"Four Centuries of American Education\", Barton makes a great case for religious based education.<br \/><br \/>However, Barton copies four questions from an 1862 fourth grade Geography test from Chicago Public schools ON PAGE 3. On page 3 where the book begins, copied \"PRINCIPLE\" instead of \"PRINCIPAL\" in the fourth question. This question SHOULD have read, per the original document (which is posted below the copied questions, ), \"Name the principal animals of the frigid zones.\".<br \/><br \/> In a book focused on 400 years of education in America, you would THINK the author would realize that, in dealing with a homophone (sounds similar,spelled differently,different meaning), he would at least copy exactly from the primary source rather than use a word with a completely different meaning (\"principal\" means primary; whereas \"principle\" means a rule or code of conduct). Such an obvious error immediately plants seeds of doubt in the credibility of the author when neither author nor editor caught this obvious error before going to print.<br \/><br \/>On page 14-15 he lists undocumented assertions on the Protestant Reformation . He claims that it started in the 15th century (1400s) when it actually began in 1517 when Martin Luther nailed his \"95 Theses\" to the door of Wittenburg Castle which was in the 16th century (Barton fails to mention Luther's actions as its beginning). Without Luther, there may have never been a Reformation at all.<br \/><br \/>Barton accuses Henry VIII of taking all church property not in agreement with the Church of England, However, unless I can be shown differently, Henry VIII, with the help of Thomas Cromwell, his Chief \"confiscate monasteries,friaries and convents of the Catholic church to fund his low treasury to wage war.<br \/><br \/>Barton cites on page 31, that as Washington was speaking to the Delaware Native Americans in May of 1779 claiming Washington was recommending American schools to the children of the Delaware Chiefs including that they will learn \"above all\" ...\"the religion of Jesus Christ\".<br \/><br \/>Washington was visited by these chiefs who were on their way to DC to present Congress with a list of requests INCLUDING the education of their children in the teachings of Jesus. Washington, as the Commanding General, could not guarantee any promise in response to these demands. Only Congress could. Washington simply responded to THEIR points from THEIR petition to Congress to appease without approving their requests. Washington NEVER volunteered to teach the Delawares about Jesus. This is the very revisionist history Barton rails against. Question everything. Never take anything at face value.<br \/><br \/>If he had notes to back up his assertiions ,the reader could check the author's sources and make up their own mind.<br \/><br \/>While I agree with what Barton is trying to say regarding the inclusion of religious instruction in school, his inattention to detail, improper citation and absence of proper citations, hold his credibility in question as a serious historian lending a small degre of credence to the arguments of his critics.<br \/><br \/>Overall, a good read, but not well documented.","parent_asin":"1932225323","timestamp":1344207343000,"helpful_vote":8,"verified_purchase":true}

{"rating":4,"title":"I hope you love Tom Pisser as much as I did!","text":"Jon Methven has a knack for blurring the lines between the lurid and the sublime; he can make the the sensational be transcendent. This book, despite the dung that is the narrator's life, is fun. And funny. And if I really take my thumbnail and scratch beneath the surface a little, more like real life than we might want to admit.<br \/><br \/>I think I was supposed to find Tom Pistilini, the narrator of \"Therapy Mammals,\" loathsome. But I didn't. In many respects he was revolting but I found his honesty and demeanor rather glorious. I loved every minute I spent with him. He's the sort of guy who asks bus drivers, with startling nonchalance, if they have ever killed anyone. Which is an absurd thing to ask; but on the other hand, the expression \"if you ever get hit by a bus\" as a euphemism for death must've come from somewhere right? This book is filled with those idiosyncratic nuances. Tom Pistilini is filled with observations and insights and predispositions we likely would - if we were committed to authenticity - find ourselves thinking and doing.<br \/><br \/>Methven is a writer who sees details and moods and emotions and absurdities in the world. And he has an ability to put what he sees on paper. The world Methven creates in this book is astonishingly realized and astonishingly funny and astonishingly messed up. It's a reminder that we are not as sophisticated as we think; that we have some work to do. But it's also reassurance that as long as we have our sense of humor then there is nothing we can't get through.","parent_asin":"194557299X","timestamp":1535375181795,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true}

{"rating":5,"title":"Breakenridge Provides the “Answers” Today’s Comms Leaders Need","text":"I’ve known Deirdre as a collaborator, mentor, and (most importantly) friend for over ten years. Her knowledge and foresight about our profession and its direction is trusted by volumes of leaders, students, and brands worldwide. Having known this book was coming, and having read all of her others, Deirdre offered me a copy (for ethical and transparency sake, I offered to blog and write a review on Amazon). I have never been disappointed in the books she has written or co-written because they are filled with information we, as public relations pros need.<br \/>Deirdre starts off the book with a perfect introduction: “Every modern communicator has a question.” Frankly, we do (and should always have them). This kicks off over 150 questions today’s pros ask. Some range from simple, while others focus on the more challenging. The questions spread over eight chapters, like “Learning the Essentials,” Taking Your Stories to the Next Level,” and “Measuring Your Success.” Sprinkled along the way are insights from respected professionals Gini Dietrich, Neal Schaffer, and Heather Whaling.<br \/>“Answers for Modern Communicators” goes beyond just being a follow-these-points-and-you’ll-make-it book. In fact, none of Deirdre’s books take that outline. It’s “Answers,” though, that helps to guide, nurture, and offer advice to all from her vast experience in the communications field. Without question, this book will be one that you constantly refer back to, highlight with a pen (I did), and reference in a blog, class lecture, or a podcast.<br \/>As long as Deirdre Breakenridge continues to write books to guide our practice with her honest insights and career experience, we should all read and listen.<br \/>I’m glad I did for “Answers” and will continue to listen and learn from a trusted industry leader and friend.","parent_asin":"0415303923","timestamp":1524627969520,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

The whole analogy to Peyton Place was groundless and overdone.  The townspeople distrust Annie for no reason except that she was a fan of Grace Metalious when she was growing up.  The author could have come up with better.  She's back to look into her mother's death from a fall due to poor balance.  Out of thin air, Annie decides it's not really Parkinson's that her mother had, but mercury poisoning, and that it must be the mill that's at fault.  What's more, characters undergo sudden revelations and transformations that are not organic to the novel.  In a Hallmark feel-good sort of way her sister and brother-in-law and all the town and the mill's employees suddenly  join her in fighting the mill.  I'm hoping other books by this author will be better.","parent_asin":"0743246446","timestamp":1124752302000,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":5,"title":"My favorite leasure read.","text":"For all of you who love reading but haven't been able to get your hands on an intriguing book in a while, look no further. You have found \"the one.\" This book is jammed pack with hours of fun reading! The 1,232 pages of statutes fly by! I originally bought this book to read to my young children (ages 3 and 5) before bedtime, but I've since discovered that it's perfect for all ages (yes, even that old mother-in law that you can't get rid of). I must admit, that I was skeptical as I read the first section of the book which covers definitions used throughout. The 3.1 lbs also weighed against my favoring the book. However, it really picks up when you get to section two. For all of you who love leasing goods (don't we all!) there's even a section for you: section 2A! I'm telling you, this book is for everyone! At first my husband hated it because I wouldn't put it down (as I cooked, I read; as I ate, I read; as we...) but then he read a couple pages and LOVED it! I even had to buy him his own copy (he couldn't borrow mine because I continue to re-read it. You really notice a lot of nuances that escape you during the 7th re-reading). I can't wait for the next year's edition! So, if you're kinda on the fence on whether or not to shell out the $49.50--go for it!!!<br \/><br \/>EDIT: I would like to thank all the wonderful people who found this review helpful. I know them, and I know how much they love this book. I think it's safe to say that this review speaks for all of us UCC lovers!<br \/><br \/>I'd like to also add that this book does more than tell a story through a statutory lens; it also contributes comments after every section. So, if you're like me and can't figure things out for yourself, you'll benefit from the commentary of the brilliant authors! But the comments do more than, well, comment. They also provide a special nugget of information that's not provided in the statute itself. If you enjoy reading the statutes, you'll love the comments just as much. It's like falling in love (with the statutes) and then falling in love again with someone else (the comments after every statute). So, what did the publisher do to remedy this situation (remedies, by the way, are also discussed in this lovely text)? They merged them together! It's the perfect polygamist lifestyle! You get to enjoy them both at the same time! I can love my statutes AND commentary without guilt!<br \/><br \/>So if you haven't purchased this book yet, DO IT! Best $49.50 ever spent. Now, excuse me while I go read Section 2-710 to my sweet children as they fall asleep. I can only hope that tonight they'll be dreaming of the UCC!","parent_asin":"0735590591","timestamp":1304362253000,"helpful_vote":16,"verified_purchase":true}

It had its parts that would make me cry, and its parts that would make me laugh, but the whole story was intriguing.  The way the author wrote it so that each individual character had their own way of speaking and their own unique dialect made it easier to relate to one or more of the characters.  I found myself sympathizing with all the characters at very different times.  I felt as though the girls' father was no only a bad man, but one who made excuses for the cruel and inhumane things that he did to his own children.  If I were the main characters friend, I would probably have asked someone for help, or gotten help for them myself.  One other thing I liked about the book was the fact that neither of the girls had mothers.  This shows very well that it doesn't matter the color of your skin or the amount of money in your pocket, all people are equal and can have the same problem or conflict, but each person has their own way to deal with it.","parent_asin":"0440219604","timestamp":1147893907000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

The author says that if a rod is broken near the tip, you should put a new tip on it and live with the fact that the rod is shorter. How does one do this? \"...epoxy the new tip top  into place.\" He describes how to remove a word cork handle in less than half a page, then tells us how to install a new one: \"Proceed by installing a factory-built handle or using cork rings then shaping the handle as is best suited to your needs.\" I don't find that description informative or helpful. There is a chapter (two pages) on thread wrapping, which talks about color choice and discusses whether to cover the thread with thread sealer before applying epoxy, but no description is made of doing the actual wrapping and tying off the thread.<br \/><br \/>The rest of his instructions are similarly cryptic, and most pages contain a few sentences and some blank space or unhelpful illustrations. He spends a page describing his own lathe, but doesn't tell us what this machine has to do with graphite rod repair. In fact, it appears to be used for rod building, not rod repair, and he does not describe how to use it. Why, then, is it included in this book?

Mr. Platt gives just enough theory for you to have a basic understanding of why the circuit works. On the other hand, he doesn't really give you the opportunity to test your knowledge of the components and the interactions between components; instead, you robotically build the circuits that he has designed. It would have been nice to see exercises where you take what you have learned and apply it to solve a new problem. I think exercises like this would build confidence.

{"rating":5,"title":"Bisous & Brioche: Authentic, Gorgeous & Deliciously French","text":"This review marks my very first of a cookbook , which frankly surprises me as I tend to purchase cookbooks almost as often  as I buy a gallon of milk.  There's just something about opening a cookbook for the first time and wondering, as I page through it, which recipe, if any, will wind up becoming a family favorite.  For me, discovering a good recipe in a cookbook is like meeting a new friend at a party.  And if it's a great recipe, it's a little like falling in love.  Well, I fell hard and fast for Bisous & Brioche, and not just because of a recipe or two.  The whole book stole my heart.<br \/><br \/>Part of its initial appeal was no doubt timing.  I discovered the cookbook two years into the pandemic, during both a lingering quarantine slump and a hardcore Francophile spell.  Yearning to travel, I found myself craving French comfort food eaten al fresco, deep in the French countryside.  Although I already owned several good cookbooks on French cuisine, I wanted something more authentic than what they offer.  I wanted to make food that transported me straight to the French supper table, dishes not created by professional chefs or expat cooking instructors or bestselling American cookbook authors who frequent the markets in Paris between stints on a cooking channel or columns in a newspaper.  I wanted to recreate a real-deal French family meal in my very own American home.<br \/><br \/>Bisous & Brioche delivered, thanks to the talents and tastes of its author, Canadian memoirist Laura Bradbury, her husband Franck, born and bred in Burgundy, and his family.  The recipes in this book are, for the most part, their own, ones they've prepared and perhaps tweaked time and again.  While some are ones you might expect in any classic French cookbook -- Coq au Vin, Beef Bourguignon, Salade Nicoise, Gougeres, Madeleines and French Apple Cake -- others are surprisingly unique and startlingly simple, like Radishes with Butter and Salt.  (Who knew a radish could ever taste so good?)  My personal favorites?  I haven't tried them all yet because I keep returning to the Salmon Papillote with Franck's Asparagus, generously dolloped with a creamy dill and yogurt sauce.  It just keeps on calling to me.  And what I thought might prove to be a taste dud -- the Rustic Lentil and Potato Stew -- couldn't have surprised me more in terms of its simple, savory and deeply comforting yumminess.  I'll make it forever.  There are more, but I'll leave the discovery up to you.  Why spoil the thrill you'll get when finding your very own next great dish?<br \/><br \/>I intend to try every recipe in this book, from the sauces, seasonings and vinaigrettes in its first chapter to the cakes, mousses and sorbet in its \"Sweet Finish.\"  It's a tall order for a fickle cookbook hoarder like me.  But I know I will because, unlike the other cookbooks I own, I often pull this one off the shelf just for a quick hit of inspiration.  Pardon the pun, but Bisous & Brioche is also a feast for the eyes, due to the gorgeous contributions of Canadian food photographer Rebecca Wellman.  Every photo of every recipe puts me right there at the rustic supper table of a wonderful and welcoming home cook somewhere, perhaps everywhere, in France.  And when the photography doesn't have me sitting at the table, it takes me on a stroll through the charming streets, fields, and villages of Burgundy.  And that warm and welcoming vibe I mentioned?  That's all Laura Bradbury, whose open, honest writing is sure to put even the most anxious and inexperienced of home cooks at ease.  I dare anyone to buy this book and not be inspired.<br \/><br \/>Bisous & Brioche turned out to be just what I needed, when I needed it most.  My advice?  Get a copy while you still can.","parent_asin":"1771513160","timestamp":1685296437947,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true}

When the author reminds us that we do not choose God but rather God chooses us, Christians should realize that they cannot stand in the way of anyone seeking to hear God's word.  God only elects and as in any group, only God knows which person!  We should accept any person as a child of God, while not being compelled to endorse behavior that is not pleasing to God.

She was a prominent poet and illustrator back in the 1800s whose distinct artwork spawned many imitators.  You know your work is unique when everyone wants to copy it.  Her poetry has an 1800s ring to it, i.e. kind of old-fashioned for today, but it still has some truths of today.  One poem that children today can relate to is \"When We Went Out With Grandmamma.\"  The grandmother continually reminds her grandchildren that when she was a little girl, she was always well-behaved.  It seems that the older generation will always find fault with these youngsters of today no matter when they live.  I personally like the illustrations more than the poetry.

{"rating":2,"title":"A few good ideas, but parents should exercise caution.","text":"Dobson makes a genuine effort to give parents well-balanced advice when it comes to discipline, but unfortunately manages only to temper his suggestions with euphemisms that make the actions appear more acceptable to parents but no less severe to their children.<br \/>When recommending that parents strike their children with switches or belts, for instance, he stipulates that they should be \"small\" switches or belts (page 46), presumably to make the idea less harsh to his readers.  Children, however, are sure to be hurt to the same degree regardless of the size of the belt with which they are being struck.<br \/>Though he truly tries to be even-handed, referring to children as \"vulnerable little creatures who need buckets of love and tenderness every day of their lives\" (page 73), Dobson cannot stop himself from recommending that discipline start at eight months, and claims that a baby who still wears diapers should not be spanked through his diapers (as that would cause no pain), but given \"two or three stinging strokes on the legs with a switch\" (page 47).<br \/>He tries to garner support for this kind of treatment by postulating that \"The entire human race is afflicted with ... tendency toward willful defiance\" (page 17) and de-humanizing children by describing them with any number of insulting adjectives and analogies, even going so far as to seriously suggest that there are infants who are \"defiant upon exit from the womb\" (page 20).  Christian parents may also be insulted at his assertion that the Bible commands that they hit their children.<br \/>He does actually suggest some creative ideas - for instance, his \"Attitude Chart\" on page 58, but most of these suggestions are tainted by his constantly linking them with corporal punishment.  In order to take advantage of them, readers will have to wade through pro-spanking rhetoric and disentangle them from the abundant suggestions that they slap, swat, strike, deceive, intimidate, and otherwise mistreat their young children.<br \/>Some moral judgment on the part of the reader is necessary, as well, in the face of Dobson's clear suggestions that they deliberately lie to and trick their children into behaving.  For instance, with regard to the \"Attitude Chart\" mentioned earlier, Dobson states that \"Although this...evaluation process has the appearance of being objective to the child, it is obvious that the parent can influence the outcome...(it's called cheating)\" (page 59).  Similar discretion will have to be used in taking Dr. Dobson's advice on children's feelings: He openly states that the child should not be permitted to say \"I hate you\" after being punished and twists that expression of honest emotion into a temper tantrum for which the child should be punished further (page 27).<br \/>All in all, parents may be able to implement some of Dobson's more thoughtful ideas without resorting to the callous treatment he advocates, but I would suggest some more gentle and considerate books to moderate it as well, like Dr. William Sears' _The Baby Book_ and _Raising Your Child Not by Force but by Love_ by Sidney Craig.","parent_asin":"084236661X","timestamp":986159258000,"helpful_vote":20,"verified_purchase":false}

There was a look into so many people and all of their character flaws and expectations. I like the balance the author gave between those who stood true to their titles and stations in life and those who were more concerned with the truth of who they really were. I loved the clashes between the sassy aunt to the obnoxious one.  At the same time, they both had a soft heart for those they loved.

Stories start out with Parker's wife abusing their marriage and the two of them getting divorced. By the end of the last book life has turned around for Parker in a very positive way. They hunt, find, and capture the criminals. I loved these stories as well as The Taken series and Blue Steele series and the Caliber Detective Agency.

Unfortunately, his boring take on &quot;The Ten Commandments Version 2.0&quot; is included in this book.<br \/>The book's highlight is O'Rourke's riotous essay on driving instruction and if you're a diehard fan, you'll want the book just for that. His evisceration of an academic task force's namby-pamby &quot;Guidelines for Bias-Free Writing&quot; is classic. And he ingeniously morphs a child-rearing story into a parable on sexual harassment.<br \/>However, P.J. is at his best when he's mixing it up with real people, doing ground-level reporting. He just doesn't do as much of that as he used to, preferring instead to weave semi-imaginary characters into the narrative. As he becomes more of a homebody, his writing inevitably suffers. Who says women are the only people who have to choose between career and family?<br \/>So who will claim O'Rourke's mantle? Jonah Goldberg is funny but doesn't do much reporting.

I read it both as the Kindle version, and the also listened to the audio book.Linda Kovic- Skow tells with humour and a  delightful writing style of her years  as an au-pair girl with an aristocratic French family. Her hopes for an exciting adventure are squashed when she is faced with the reality of  being at the merciless beck and call of her French host family. Of course, taking place in France, a romantic affair of the heart is thrown in. I couldn't put the book down in order to see if it all ended  in tears or in a happy outcome for young Linda. I enjoyed revisiting the book with the  audio vision that brought the story to life, and I was delighted to freshen up my French a bit at the same time.","parent_asin":"1457514575","timestamp":1431900710000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true}

The investigation is very detailed and riveting. A lot of Imanishi's early leads turn out to be false starts, which causes the case to stall, but he is relentless and pursues every avenue. This is a whodunit, plain and simple. Just when I thought I had guessed where the investigation is going, a new wrinkle comes along and I really understood the frustration that Imanishi was going through. Superb translation.

The one consistently good thing in her life are her horses and the friends she makes through them. When she meets a man who seems to be a throwback to the old days of the cowboys, she allows him to show her a new trail; a trail to confidence, maturity and a whole new future that she had never even considered was there.<br \/><br \/>Written as a tale that Roni as an adult is telling her grandchildren, this story is rich with  adventure, humor, tragedy and revelations. Full of memorable characters - human, equine, canine and spirit-- and  surrounded with the glorious high desert scenery of the Wilderness pack station where Roni lives alone for a winter, I greatly enjoyed traveling along with the author as she made her way up that Longest Trail.

It essentially kept me reading until the end and I did get a sense that I wanted questions answered and I wanted to essentially know \"who did it and how\". So if thats a measure of success and what you're looking for, then definitely consider this.<br \/><br \/>But having said that, a few critical points that left me feeling a bit disappointed on completing it -<br \/><br \/>1 > too many coincidences as opposed to presenting facts and putting 2+2 together. It felt like as a reader I wasn't able to make any of my own deductions because until a coincidence happened, it was all too abstract, and when a coincidence did happen I felt like \"so if you hadn't bumped into that person or if you hadn't read that story in a paper that had happened to be overheard in the first place, then this story would be a total dead fish\".<br \/><br \/>2 > too many dead ends (for instance the whole Kamata thing, with Waga sending Miyata to act suspiciously which seemed a little pointless in some respects) that when resolved did have a place in the plot, but felt like they could easily have been written out and the story condensed. It just got to the point where I felt like \"this isn't going anywhere, and I'm starting not to care\", which then relied too much on my diligence as a reader to keep on going.<br \/><br \/>Maybe its because this is quite an old book that it has a much slower pace and required a reader of that time who may have been happy to be drawn along without understanding or deducting anything for larger chunks, but overall while I liked it enough to finish, I knew straight away that I'd be very unlikely to read it again.

{"rating":2,"title":"Huge Disappointment","text":"Unfortunately, this book was a huge disappointment.  As a fellow Michigander and lifelong hunter\/fisherman beginning in the mid-50's, I looked forward to reading the book.  An NRA Life Member and staunch supporter of the shooting sports I anticipated passing the book on to my hunting sons and grandsons.  That will not happen.<br \/>  The book is preoccupied with narratives of youthful and not-so-youthful transgressions of the law and hunter ethics.  He expounds on a litany of violatiions committed by himself, his brothers, father, and or associates.  Among them:  multiple examples of \"shoot 'n run\" trespassing; illegally hunting underage using weapons unlawful for his age; shooting into squirrel nests; vandalizing lawfully placed survey stakes on private property; painting \"no cut\" on trees of surveyed property; illegally trapping restriced species; using unlawful trapping methods in Michigan (snares); illlegally selling game fish (smelt); shooting salmon with shotgun; describing illegal procurement of \"camp meat\"; rationalizing \"ground slucing\"; ad infinitum.  Although the author occassionally expresses regrets, the impression is left wanting.<br \/>  Strangely, he finds it necessary to denigrate those who choose to hunt\/fish in ways divergent from his.  His criticisims of \"golfers\" is weirdly bizarre.  He castigates hunters who engage in the \"pathetic practice of hunting animals inside high wire fences\", and in doing so uses unnecessary crudities.  \"Pathetic\" if it's 200 acres, 2,000, or 20,000 acres?  Baiting is clearly different than finding that perfect grove of bearing white oaks, but to unnecessarily denigrate fellow hunters for engaging in such legal activities is counterproductive. In a ridiculous and misguided manner he castigates those who engage in \"catch & release\" fishing.<br \/>  I'm not sure what the author sought to accomplish with this book.  Self confession (with occassional expressions of contrition)? Build himself up as \"the\" he-man woodsman\/adventurer of the 21st century?  Who knows?  His braggadocio approach lacks consideration for fellow sportsmen who do things differently than he does them.  He shows little regard for the many enthusiastic, ethical sportsmen and women who lack the same opportunities of time, circumstance, opportunity and financial resources to access the desirable hunting & fishing locations he is privelaged to enjoy.  The apparant \"my way or the highway\" approach taken is disappointing, especially coming from an individual having his level of public visibility.<br \/>  The book falls agonizingly short in presenting the positive image of sportsmen most would like portrayed.","parent_asin":"0385529813","timestamp":1358202077000,"helpful_vote":29,"verified_purchase":true}

I can only assume that the Dubois family chose to continue with keeping Miss Kovic on as their au pair, due to the time constraints of Madame Dubois' pregnancy due date and the fact that Madame & Monsieur Dubois also spoke english. However, the embers of this deceit never burned out as the audacity is mirrored by Madame Dubois, and at times, her daughter, when entitlement & privilege pushes against the audacious goal of the moxie young author's dream, causing a slow, steady build to a volcanic ending. With the sprinkling of romantic encounters and the omnipresence of conflicts and obstacles from the very beginning, I read with much enjoyment to the seemingly abrupt end of this story.  Was this by design?  When one is left with many questions of \"what happened next\", and \"did she ever accomplish her dream...\"  I would say the author did, indeed, leave us wanting, and anticipating a \"grittier\" French Illusions - Part II.<br \/>[[ASIN:B00BG0EV8A French Illusions: My Story as an American Au Pair in the Loire Valley (Book 1)]]","parent_asin":"1457514575","timestamp":1373848143000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false}

Her contentious situation with Madame Dubois was recounted as if it had just happened.  (At times, I felt like an unwitting intruder who walked into a tense and uncomfortable situation.)  I particularly liked a tender reminiscence cooking with her mom when she was a little girl.  And the climax of the book was explosively palpable.

As the story deepened, I cheered the protagonist's personal successes. The perfect pacing kept me reading, without a break, until I finished the book. I had to know what happened.

{"rating":5,"title":"A page tuner, even for crime drama novices","text":"Crime thrillers are not my usual genre, but after reading Proving Ground, I couldn't wait for this one.<br \/><br \/>Peter Blauner’s ability to convey police procedure is truly a gift - not simply the result of his imagination but of his deep research and observation. (He’s written\/ produced for several TV crime dramas).  The depth of details and complexity of the cases in Sunrise Highway are proof of Blauner's commitment his storytelling craft and lend credulity to each of the characters, cases, and setting.  Lordes, as well as other primary and secondary characters, are richly developed, if not deeply flawed. They are human and so we are able to connect with each and develop an interest in their how their story unfolds.  Eve  the twisted, narcissistic villain grabs your attention right up until the unexpected plot twist.<br \/><br \/>The parallel plot structure - Lordes is working a case in real time (2017) while Blauner brings us back to a series of events that began in 1977 - is part of what makes this such a compelling read. The intertwining of both storylines is part of what keeps the Sunrise Highway such a page-turner.  Murder, corruption, politics over four decades are woven together to make for a compelling story, vivid setting and characters who evoke a whole host of emotions.<br \/><br \/>I’d like to believe this is strictly literature not a reflection on life, but I am afraid much what Blauner describes happens far more than the average gal realizes.

{"rating":2,"title":"Reducing Grace to A Gimmick","text":"I'm a big fan of both Peyton Place and Grace Metalious.  I even tracked down copies of her (now out of print) books No Adam in Eden, and The Tight White Collar.  When I read the amazon summary of Looking for Peyton Place I was very interested.  I'd never read any Barbara Delinsky before, but thought I'd give her a chance.<br \/><br \/>I found the writing to be very poor, there are numerous typos in the book.  I could forgive Delinsky for using google as a verb once, but then it popped up a few more times along with the use of Blackberried as a verb.  Also, she frequently uses \"ohmigod\" in the book.  If I wanted to read internet shorthand language I would go online, not pick up a book.  I found her use of these words distracting, not to mention the awfulness of a character whispering something so cliche as \"don't want it, but will die if we stop\" into someone else's ear in the middle of sex.<br \/><br \/>The plot's not very original either.  You could easily watch Eric Brokovich and get the same thing.<br \/><br \/>In the author's note on her website Delinsky says \"Of the many books I've written, I've never received as much immediate interest from any title as I have from this one. Mention LOOKING FOR PEYTON PLACE to people, and eyes light, brows raise, smiles form.\"<br \/><br \/>She also said that you don't have to be familiar with Peyton Place to enjoy the book, but she added clever little references in the book if you were familiar with it.  Some of these references include name a character the last name of Farrow because Mia Farrow was in the tv soap, or naming streets and characters after people and places in Peyton Place.  I thought they weren't very clever at all.<br \/><br \/>The legacy of Grace Metalious and Peyton Place aren't honored in this book.  They're simply used as a gimmick.  The name of Peyton Place still stirs interest in people, and I think Delinsky exploited that fact to help sell an extremely mediocre book.","parent_asin":"0743246446","timestamp":1124425257000,"helpful_vote":9,"verified_purchase":false}

Since I'm a beginner with little experience I'm not confident on how to orient them. The fact that the author didn't have the commonsense to include markings on the images of ceramic capacitors so one could use electrolytic capacitors in their place is ridiculous! Also ceramic capacitors in the higher values that the author used were impossible to find.I believe this is why the component kits I purchased had electrolytic capacitors instead. Fortunately I found capacitors called non polarized capacitors that I could use in place of the ceramics.The book,otherwise,is quite good.

{"rating":5,"title":"An invaluable new horror journal","text":"Primeval is a new journal that, according to their website, focuses solely on \"the convergence of contemporary anxiety and ancient impulse.\" In that sense, it's antithetical to a lot of the more \"forward-thinking\" horror theory and horror-inspired non-fiction I've been reading lately. Though that's not a bad thing at all. What we have here is a lovingly curated collection of essays, stories and ephemera--with top-notch design and layout--that approaches the genre from the perspective of an archivist.<br \/><br \/>Things start off strong with a reprint of Harlan Ellison's novelette, \"Basilisk.\" Imagine the war-has-come-home dread of Deathdream mixed with the Pazuzu-flavored weirdness of Exorcist II and you sort of get the idea. Another high point is the short story \"Srendi Vashtar\" and an accompanying essay with strong psychoanalytical overtones. This one was new to me. Written by British writer H.H. Munro (using the pseudonym Saki), \"Srendi Vashtar\" is the story of ten-year-old Conradin, a boy whose meekness has marked him as not long for this world. Conradin lives under care of his cousin, a woman who \"...represented those three-fifths of the world that are necessary and disagreeable and real; the other two-fifths, in perpetual antagonism to the foregoing, were summed up in himself and his imagination.\" Conradin eventually discovers a forgotten tool-shed that quickly becomes \"a playroom and a cathedral.\" I'm sure you can imagine that things soon take a turn for the weird. Like the best Poe stories, \"Srendi Vashtar\" is as precise as clockwork. It's a new favorite and I'm grateful for being introduced to it here.<br \/><br \/>The real selling point is a previously unpublished (I think) story by Laird Barron, a writer who has quickly become a favorite of mine after reading his debut collection, The Imago Sequence. His contribution to Primeval, \"Nemesis,\" is something of a cosmic prism, a world of mirrors within mirrors--and it's worth the price of admission. This is master-class stuff.<br \/><br \/>Overall, a very solid first offering.","parent_asin":"1940250064","timestamp":1380769971000,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":true}

Smith, as Christians often are way to quick to condemn and point fingers rather than listening and loving and giving an `answer for the hope within them'.<br \/><br \/>No doubt, one can expect an English professor to write well. But there'll also be several of Rosarie's statements that will convict, others will appear narrow and preachy, and there'll be a few you won't agree with; nonetheless, this book is a worthwhile read for the objectives it strives to meat - the unveiling of `secret thoughts of an unlikely convert'.","parent_asin":"1884527388","timestamp":1374179112000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true}
{"rating":5,"title":"I wish more books were this captivating (don't pigeonhole this book as a go-to for same-sex attraction\/LGBT issues)","text":"GENRE: Autobiography<br \/><br \/>SIZE:<br \/>128 pages. 5 sections in total. I read through it, transfixed, in one evening. I wish more books were this captivating.<br \/><br \/>WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA:<br \/>Rosaria recounts how her identity as tenured feminist professor at Sycaruse University and lesbian community activist transformed into a covenant child of God, orthodox Christian and pastor's wife. Along the way she touches on topics such as repentance\/faith, homosexuality and identity, the Reformed Presbyterian (RPCNA) community, hospitality, worship principles, marriage, family, homeschooling, adoption and racial reconciliation.<br \/><br \/>EASY TO READ?<br \/>Definitely. Started it one evening and couldn't put it down. Rosaria -- an English professor by training -- writes in a very eloquent, poetic style that's not afraid to pull punches. Her prose is first-rate, and her sentences are full of gems that I found myself frequently stopping to re-read what she just said.<br \/><br \/>WHAT I APPRECIATED?<br \/>On reaching the last page, I was astounded by the incredibly life-transforming work of Christ.<br \/><br \/>Throughout the book, I was challenged on so many issues to reconsider how I think and speak about those in the LGBT community, the humiliating cost of following Christ, compassion and mercy ministry (and how secular\/LGBT communities do this better!), sexual sin and gender politics and more. Rosaria has fantastic thoughts about the indispensable role of hospitality in proclaiming the gospel.<br \/><br \/>I was surprised to find in chapter 3 a fleshed-out stand for strict regulative principle in worship (e.g. singing only Psalms during the church service). Chapters 4 and 5 talked about the sacrificial life of being a mother to biological, adopted and foster children and the classical model of homeschooling. I didn't agree with all her conclusions, but found each issue was argued passionately, logically and winsomely.<br \/><br \/>WHO I'D RECOMMEND IT TO:<br \/>While her background makes her uniquely qualified to wrestle and challenge Christians and non-Christians on their convictions on homosexuality and identity, don't pigeonhole this book as simply a go-to for same-sex attraction\/LGBT issues. As Rosaria points out herself:<br \/><br \/>\"We like to think that sin is contained by categories of logic or psychology. It's not. So why do we assume that sexual sin has sexual or affectual origins? That is because we have too narrow a focus about sexuality's purview. Sexuality isn't about what we do in bed. Sexuality encompasses a whole range of needs, demands, and desires. Sexuality is more a symptom of our life's condition than a cause, more a consequence than an origin.<br \/>So I think anyone remotely interested in hearing an intellectually and emotionally compelling case for the change the love and compassion of Christ can make -- whatever your worldview, orientation or religious conviction - will benefit from reading what Rosaria has to say. You'll enjoy an arresting autobiography that will certainly make you think.\"<br \/><br \/>VERDICT:<br \/>Must read. I agree with Carl Trueman's summary[...] \"I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I do not agree with everything she says; but I did learn from everything she wrote. It deserves the widest possible readership.\"","parent_asin":"1884527388","timestamp":1373257956000,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":true}

However, once I got to page 3, I was already invested in knowing what would happen with these children and how the story would play out.  It ended up being a quick read, simply because I couldn't put it down.  The chapters move quickly, from one \"scene\" to the next, and I HAD to know how the children, past & present, would fare.

{"rating":5,"title":"The Babe Ruth of Outdoor Writers","text":"I've been reading hunting literature for over forty years.  There have been a number of great outdoor writers.  Some, like Jack O'Connor were outstanding on hunting skills.  Lot's of others have been masters at depicting the drama of the quest.  Still others, like humorists Patrick McManus and Bill Heavey, are just very clever writers and funny as hell.<br \/><br \/>Steven Rinella is in a class by himself.  When Babe Ruth ended the dead ball era by single handedly slamming more homers each season than entire teams, they had to build a new stadium just to accommodate the bulging crowds.  For people who pour over hunting books and magazines, Rinella has the feeling of an emerging Ruth -- someone with great talents that we haven't quite witnessed before.  He is a first class writer; an honest guy who handles a controversial topic (hunting) with intelligence, wit and depth. Beyond that, he has a youthful cosmopolitan outlook that allows him to \"cross the aisle\" and reach the non-hunting community.<br \/><br \/>You will find no B.S. in this man -- about hunting or his own foibles.  Rinella's outstanding program (\"The Meateater\") reflects the integrity of his written work.  It isn't about guys sitting in blinds overlooking food plots crowded with big racked bucks -- bred and groomed to be dropped by wealthy hunters who are willing to pay the price for canned hunts.  You won't see high fives and sanitized moments of the kill.  You will see ethically harvested game in wild, free range settings, followed by what really happens among experienced hunters: field dressing of the animal and practical care for the meat. This will be followed by a creative meal (often outdoors)and a few concluding remarks that will leave you thinking (a rare accomplishment for most TV programs today).<br \/><br \/>Rinella is the closest thing the hunting community has to a good will ambassador. We would all do well to read his work and support his progress.","parent_asin":"0385529813","timestamp":1372475033000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":5,"title":"A book you can't put down until you finish the last page","text":"Service,  is Marcus Luttrell's second written documentation on what it is to be a Navy Seal and a patriotic American.  Just like one of the other reviewers of this book stated that they finished the book in less than 2 days,  I did the same.  It is a fascinating book written by a modest and heroic author who seems typical of the vast majority of Seals and many throughout our armed forces.<br \/><br \/>His first book \"Lone Survivor\" made me wonder how any human being could survive what Marcus endured during Operation Redwing.  \"Service\" even during chapters that detailed the death of his Seal brothers had uplifting moments mixed in with the pain and loss.  When Navy Seal,  J. T. Tumlinson's body was returned home following his death in Afghanistan, Marcus describes a huge unforgettable display of patriotism displayed for J. T.  Volunteers from the Patriot Guard, local police, and Navy Seals escorted J. T.'s body home and thousands of residents holding flags dressed in red, white and blue lined the roads of his home town, and attended his funeral. The story made me appreciate what makes Americans different.<br \/><br \/>This latest book shows that Marcus is evolving and changing after all that he has experienced as a warrior from his early 20's through his early 30's.  His first book really captivated me with its story of friendship, courage, and unwillingness to give up. His story covering his training and ordeals during Operation Redwing clearly shows that  Marcus and his Seal brothers are hard wired in a way different from most of us .  \"Service\",  demonstrates many of those same heroic qualities exist throughout our armed forces. The stories Marcus tells of heroic acts of courage by so many other men and women in our military should make every american who does not take our freedom for granted proud of those that serve.<br \/><br \/>As a tough fighter\/warrior the book \"Service\" points out Marcus is also flexible enough to approach his work in a different way when conditions change. Paraphrasing his words the bullet not fired can have a stronger affect on the people of Iraq than a bullet fired that kills a terrorist. This change in thinking became part of the process they used to change the battle for Ramidi, Iraq.  Instead of fighting against Iraqis the military started to embrace them, training them to fight with us against the Al Qaeda insurgents.  The change in strategy in Ramidi the book points out became an element used by General Petraeus for turning the war from military and political frustration to victory.  The chapter called My Enemy My Friend was very interesting on how the battle for Ramadi changed and the Army officer who first embraced this new approach helped to convince both our military and the Iraqis to change tactics.<br \/><br \/>After I read his first book I had the opportunity to attend a dinner where Marcus was the guest speaker.  It was very clear from his demeanor during that speech that every time he spoke about Operation Redwing it caused him great mental and even physical pain.  The entire time he spoke the room was captivated by his story as he added some details that did not appear in his book.  In his second book you thankfully see that Marcus is finding peace of mind and happiness in his life.  I highly recommend reading \"Service\" and if you ever have the chance to hear Marcus speak it is time you will be richer for spending it with a true American Patriot.","parent_asin":"0316185361","timestamp":1337746010000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":5,"title":"A Brilliant Journey","text":"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  It's intelligent, original, surprising, witty, honest, and fresh.  Thank God Dyer didn't write a \"criticism\" of DH Lawrence in the conventional sense.  Unable to write the critical study he had planned, Dyer finally just begins writing about his inability to begin.  The result is a compelling journey through Dyer's psyche, an exploration of his indecisiveness, his frustration, his depression, his unhappiness, his general rage.  If that sounds unpleasant or boring it really isn't.  It is, at times, very funny.  It's an excellently human expression of the self.  What makes the book work so well is Dyer's honesty about his own failings.  Dyer's only flaw as a writer is that he tends to drag his riffs and jokes out a bit too long.  In the beginning you laugh, and after a few pages of the same stuff you start thinking, \"OK, that's enough of that now.\"  But this is a minor complaint.  Dyer is as insightful about Lawrence--when he finally gets to Lawrence--as he is about himself.  I enjoyed this book completely and highly recommend it to anybody with a brain.  I do think it's Dyer's best book.","parent_asin":"0312429460","timestamp":1303394970000,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":4,"title":"Another one out of the park...","text":"SUNRISE HIGHWAY is the new novel from Peter Blauner, and the first time in his illustrious career that he has brought back main characters for a second go-round. Dare I say Mr. Blauner has planted the seeds for a long-running series? His many fans-and I proudly count myself among them-can only hope. Anyway, things have changed in the life of Detective Lourdes Robles since we last saw her in Blauner's previous thriller, PROVING GROUND: she has been promoted from a Brooklyn precinct detective to a member of the Queens Homicide Task Force, she has moved in with her lawyer boyfriend Mitchell, her younger sister Izzy has gone missing, and she is investigating the brutal murder of a young girl, found dead in the Rockaway section of Queens, New York.<br \/>As always with Mr. Blauner's work, the police procedures are 100% accurate and engaging, without falling into the trap of sounding like a textbook or paint-by-numbers. Peter Blauner is a writer, a storyteller, and rule number one is to entertain the reader, which he accomplishes in spades. Another rule of the thriller is to feature a compelling villain, which Mr. Blauner has also pulled off with considerable aplomb. An amoral, despicable bad guy, made more chillingly so because of the parade of enablers that surround him. But what sets Peter Blauner's work apart-what always has, in my experience, and SUNRISE HIGHWAY is certainly no exception-is his uncanny ability to weave social commentary into his prose. SUNRISE... is another example in a canon that forces the reader to look at society while at the same time be entertained by a hell of a great thrill ride. He takes us on a trip through time in the worlds of both New York City proper and its Long Island suburbs, and he make sure every 't' is crossed and every 'i' is dotted. Now, for a native New Yorker like myself, the social, racial, and economic politics of NYC\/LI are not a new phenomenon, but don't worry-when Peter Blauner is through with you, regardless of where you rest your head, you will feel right at home in either Brooklyn or Massapequa. (you may feel like a hot shower after, though, because there is corruption with a capital \"C\") And at the same time, you'll get all the thrills and chills and surprises of an absolutely spectacular read.

{"rating":5,"title":"Refreshing, substantive, and very well written","text":"This is the best testimonial I've read in a long time.  Not because Rosaria has the best conversion story.  All real conversions are sacred.  The difference is that Rosaria has the giftedness and skills to describe in detail the various aspects of herself being converted little by little.<br \/><br \/>Rosaria's story is really everyone's story, that is, for all who are being conformed into the image of Christ.  Perhaps a more accurate title for this book is \"Secret Thoughts of an ACTUAL Convert.\"  Rosaria seems to be actually converting day by day more and more--as all professing Christians should be doing.<br \/><br \/>In my opinion, one special thing about Rosaria is that God has entrusted to her an identity gift of sorts.  Whereas she speaks of her past lesbian life as an \"identity sin,\" I would say that she now has an identity gift.  In other words, she gets it that her WHOLE IDENTITY is being made new in Christ.  In a sense her book is a description of her Spirit-transformed identity.<br \/><br \/>One of my favorite things about the book is all of Rosaria's questions.  She asks so many probing questions.  I think that's partly how God has guided her to discover so much truth so quickly.  Moreover, she takes inventory of what exactly she has learned.  Here's a little segment that exemplifies both her question-asking and recounting of what she's learned:<br \/><br \/>\"I had gotten used to the fact that that in every Ken Smith sermon, my still-kicking feminist sensibilities would be offended--deeply.  Ken used the male pronoun exclusively and once used 'totalitarian' throughout a whole sermon when he really meant to say 'totalizing.'  I was seething.  And, oddly enough, I kept coming back for more.  Was I a masochist, I wondered?  Or was I learning to forbear?  I came to believe that my job was not to critique and 'receive' a sermon, but to dig into it, seize its power, to participate with its message, and to steal its fruit.  I learned by sitting under Ken Smith's preaching that the easily offended are missing the point.\"<br \/><br \/>I don't have the same theology as Rosaria in every way (e.g. I disagree with the view of male headship she presents), but I recognize the Lord she bows to, and I applaud her commitment to be truthful and seek truth.  Plus I'm thankful for her love for her old friends in the GLBTQQ community who might be drag queens or whatever.  Rosaria says rightly that we all share the same humanity.<br \/><br \/>In closing I will say that while I understand the reviewers who expressed their delight in Chapter 1 and disappointment with the rest of the book, I nonetheless appreciate all of Rosaria's book because it is Rosaria's story.  In order to introduce herself, she shares her new identity as a believer, an intellectual (though she berates herself unnecessarily regarding her smarts), a churchgoing worshiper, a wife, a mother, a teacher.  And all through the book she says deep, insightful things such as, \"Betrayal and risk are at the heart of the gospel life.\"","parent_asin":"1884527388","timestamp":1411944326000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":5,"title":"Vison Quest","text":"The author’s journey is a vision quest in the truest sense of the word.<br \/> She’s a teenager in the tumultuous sixties—without a father, at odds with her mother, spending time with questionable friends, and seemingly headed straight for disaster. Like many young girls, she loves horses, and this is what saves her.<br \/> Horses, and a mentor who comes into her life. She hangs out at the local stable and meets John Slaughter, a cowboy of the old tradition, who runs a pack station in the mountains out of the Owens Valley. With a lifetime’s knowledge of horses and human nature under his belt, he recognizes something in this troubled girl. He recognizes not only her honest and passionate love for horses; he also sees a young woman capable of learning, thinking for herself and assuming responsibility.<br \/> As she works at the stable and the pack station, Roni learns the ways of horses. She makes plenty of beginner’s mistakes, but she’s a keen observer of horses and their unique psychology. When she runs into a problem, she’s willing to try one thing, and if that doesn’t work, she finds another approach. As she learns, her mentor gives her more responsibility, and more opportunity.  After she has worked for several years caring for the horses, handling, riding and packing with them, John offers Roni the chance to spend the winter at the pack station, alone, with only her two dogs and the horses for company. This time spent alone in the desert, many miles from the nearest town becomes the core of her transformation.<br \/> Being alone with nature to seek one’s true place and purpose in life is an integral part of the search for a vision, whether it be a Native American rite of passage, or Jesus going into the wilderness. Deeply sensitive to her surroundings, Roni soon makes spiritual contact with the indigenous inhabitants of this harsh but beautiful land. She also finds another mentor, a local sheriff and member of the Paiute tribe, who helps her understand her experiences.<br \/> Roni’s unvarnished conversational writing style keeps the reader right there with her, as she lives and works with the horses who are her partners and companions, and goes through her daily routine without the conveniences that most of us take for granted. We’re with her as she guides hunters and city folks into the mountains, and we see the majesty and grandeur of the high country from the back of a horse—and there is nothing grander than this perspective.<br \/> The author’s warmth, love and caring for her human and animal friends shows clearly in every detail, and yet, she’s able to stand her ground, with hilarious results, when a group of flatlanders who have hired her to guide them, fail to respect the laws of nature. We’re there with her when she takes off on solitary adventures on her beloved appaloosa, Hellzapoppin.’ The suspense when she gets into a tight spot is palpable, even though we know she’ll live to tell the tale.<br \/> Don’t miss this book! If you love horses, coming-of-age stories, adventure, or just love the clear, bracing air and vivid descriptions of the high country, you’ll be off on an unforgettable ride, and you’ll yearn for more when it ends.","parent_asin":"1478235845","timestamp":1431896125000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false}

Or he\/she determines from stories heard<br \/>or movies seen that being a soldier is what they want (maybe a way of thinking they are<br \/>shirking work). (For a former humble Navy Pilot, #3 definition always seemed more<br \/>appropriate in my mine for our special operations units, especially the larger head,<br \/>metaphor intended, trust me they understand).<br \/>A gladiator on the other hand knows and is inherently determined to give Service and be<br \/>trained in the knowledge of a \"fight to the death\" struggle by profession. There is no<br \/>causal thought given. It is a life passion to Serve and be the absolute best. To be a Navy<br \/>Seal certainly epitomizes this passion. This is not to de-emphasize the other military<br \/>groups but many books exist about their stories. This review is about a local boy, a man<br \/>of survival and struggle who viewed the world differently and made the grade to<br \/>ultimate fighter and survivor. This is a review of Marcus Luttrell, Navy Seal, hero and<br \/>just a \"good ol' boy\" from Texas.<br \/>When you read the book \"Service\" and have read Marcus's previous book \"Lone<br \/>Survivor\" you immediately know you are rooting in with and living vicariously through<br \/>the eyes of everything you think you want to be as a soldier. Yet, there is more and I<br \/>mean much more to belonging to this elite category of soldiering.<br \/>As I came off the mountain with Marcus during Operation Redwing in the book Lone<br \/>Survivor, and had seen my buddies and fellow brothers, who I would have died for, lose<br \/>their battle against overwhelming forces my heart and head went into his world and from<br \/>the comfort of my easy chair fought the same battle of survival. I needed to know more<br \/>and wanted a better taste of what created this unique individual, only to find out that<br \/>\"from womb to tomb\" (their personal motto) there are two of them, both Navy Seals and<br \/>twins. Morgan is the brother who seals this unique bond that motivates and heals<br \/>physical and emotional situations and creates an inter-mixed sixth sense. There is no<br \/>one-up-man-ship from either, other than who was first out of the womb (coming in<br \/>second to a Seal is first loser).<br \/>The book Service will provide a unique perspective to what it is to be a Navy Seal, to<br \/>fight in the most hostile of environments and to survive. The fellowship expressed with<br \/>the other service groups (and don't use the term Special Forces, the why as explained on<br \/>page 334) who make the ultimate sacrifice \"to save your sorry butt\" (my emphasis)<br \/>because you are one of them is well presented throughout the book. The closeness you<br \/>have meeting and knowing fellow Texans who are making the same commitment to<br \/>Service that you are, gives comfort and a connection to home we all seem to seek.<br \/>Surviving an ordeal such as Operation Redwing was just a start of the break-down we all<br \/>encounter as we go back into the field only to find out that our bodies, thanks to age and<br \/>the rigorous outrage we put it through, are no longer \"up to the task\" and the let down<br \/>you feel failing to fulfill a mission or being part of \"the team\" as described in the book<br \/>Service.<br \/>Yes, I recommend each and every young man or woman who defines themselves as a<br \/>future soldier or ultimate warrior to read the book Service and insure that the decision<br \/>they are about to make is in line with their passion and commitment.

But my commitments towards my family over the weekend, did not allow me to do that. Now before you roll your eyes and say \"excuses, excuses\" let me warn you that I am a parent of a 11 year old who is getting adept at rolling eyes and so when I was reading the book, \" ALL Pro Dad\" by Mark Merrill, his first reaction was, you've guessed it right, he playfully rolled his eyes.<br \/><br \/>I must admit that when i recieved the book in the mail, which had a headline \" Seven essential skills to be a hero to your kids\" I was a bit, skeptical, after all, Parenting is a bit of an intuitive play.But as went through with what Mark Merrill had to say, I concede that he got it right. Somewhere along the line, as Dads, we surrendered our leadership or status as role models, to others. Today's kids have TV characters, movie stars, sportstars, or in some cases business leaders as heroes. The media places these successful people on a pedestal and the phenomena of hero worship often borders on cultish following. While I am all for people inspiring us on a daily basis, the role of a Dad must be central to a child's growth and worldview.<br \/><br \/>Mark Merrill is a familiar name in the world of football and parenting. this book is a good book with some foundational principles that call all dads to basics. The foreword written by Tony Dungy talks about how is book is essentially about two qualities - love and leadership. And I suspect ( my own understanding) that if you do one without the other, you'll have a lopsided experience of raising a child. If you go completely with the love paradigm, you'll have pampered and smothered the child with affection. On the otherhand, if you rule with an iron fist ( as is likely to happen in Occidental cultures) the child is raised without the softer, gentler aspects of fatherhood. Tough Love is a balance of influencing a strong willed kid, without breaking down the child.<br \/><br \/>The seven principles make  easy reading. Much like a Football coach's playbook, each chapter follows an M. Know your Make up, Know your Mind-set,Know your Motive, Know your Method, Know your Model, Know your Message and Know the Master.  While I concede that there is no, \"One size fit all\" approach to parenting, each chapter had something that got me scratching my head. For instance in the chapter \" Know your Mindset\" he talks about Love. While this word is by far, the most nebulous word, which could have a gazillion connotations, he distills it to two words - Patience and Kindness. As type A folks, most Dads can agree that it can be a challenge to be patient and kind to our own children all the time. How does one show kindness when you need to literally drag them or drive them into the bathroom as the clock ticks away? How does one show patience when you recieve a \"love letter\" from school? (Loveletter is a euphemism our family uses for any communication from school, usually unflattering). I learnt from this book that being a great dad is not about fulfulling my ego trips but to serve my child, selflessly. Quite an ideal to aspire but probably the only one that works. Written in sporty metaphors and adrenaline pumping navy SEALs language, this book appeals to young men who sincerely desire to train themselves to be a good dad. But that would call for a lifetime of commitment to the mission. It may mean tearing myself from the cricket matches on TV ( that seem to go on all year long) or my toys, my gadgets, my expectations and focus on giving myself.<br \/><br \/>So this father's day, instead of basking in the glory due to me ( for atleast one day in the year) I asked my son, what is the one thing that you'd like me to change as Dad? He gave four answers but top of the list was\" I wish you spend less time on your laptop\"  We spent most of the day, chasing each other around the house, playing chess and have wrestling bouts.  I wish I could do it all year, or till the time he grows up.<br \/><br \/>While the book \" ALL PRO Dad\" touts itself as a game winning playbook for every father. My take is that every dad should spend some time, writing out a gameplan for each child. When you write something down, and show it your child, you are commiting yourself to that child, each day, each year, for a life time.","parent_asin":"1595555072","timestamp":1340118988000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false}

Not to downplay the information contained in the book itself, which is awesome.<br \/>The key to making change is to make small changes, baby steps, slowly building your new lifestyle.

It gives seven essential truths for us follow. I also enjoyed the \"Huddle questions\" given to ask your kid's at the end of each chapter.<br \/><br \/>The book gives some decent insight into some fundamentals on how to be a good husband and father. I enjoyed quotes from and stories from famous football players and coaches such as Peyton Manning, Mark Richt, and Tony Dungee. The book is a real encouragement to Dad's who can know they aren't alone in their struggles to keep balance in their lives.<br \/><br \/>Another thing I really enjoy is following the All Pro Dad website and Facebook page. They give several resources including blogs, videos, and top ten list to farther encourage men in their walk. They give great advice on how to leave a legacy people will remember. I appreciate how the recognize that the only way to be an All Pro is to look to look up to our heavenly father for the way. The only negative I would say is the book isn't necessarily a really deep book. It doesn't delve deep into the scriptures like some do. However, I think that is okay here. They give practical day to day advice on how to stay consistent with our families and give what they really need, love and time. All in all, i would say the book is pretty good. It would make a great gift to friend or fellow dad who might be struggling with reaching a balanced life between work and kid's and everything else that is going on. I give the book 4 out of 5 stars.

Every detail is important.  It's fun for a mystery lover because there are tiny clues that let you try and piece things together as you read.<br \/><br \/>It's also a great adoption story.  The way that the adoptive mother supports her daughter's quest to find her birth mother finally gives credit to all the amazing adoptive mothers out there!  Children who are adopted can read this book to think through some of the feelings they might have.  Although the book is light reading, it brings up some important issues for discussion like how a child can have room to love adopted parents and birth parents both or finding a birth parent and possibly being disappointed.<br \/><br \/>It's exciting for adopted children to find a heroine who will make them comfortable with their story.  In this book, adoption is normal!  And, since the author is one of the nation's leading therapists with adopted children, she knows what she's talking about.  The portrayals of the complexities of emotion around adoption resonate with real life.","parent_asin":"1885938446","timestamp":1369916551000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true}

{"rating":5,"title":"Kirsten; A Journey to a Special Time","text":"Joining Kirsten in her travel from Sweden to the United States and then on to the forests of Minnesota has been an enjoyable and interseting experience for both my daughter and I.  The pioneer time of our country's history has always been of an interest to me as I have read of my own family's journeys from Hingham England to Massachusetts and then on to Montana during the time of the late 1600's through the early 1800's.  What a rich heritage they passed on.  And now, my daughter can enjoy learning about the pioneer era with a girl her own age.  We have had a great deal of enjoyment reading these books together and discussing what happened to Kirsten in each one.  Especially interesting and enlightening are the &quot;Peek Into the Past&quot; sections found at the end of each book.  We have had some interesting and lively discussions about what it would be like to live during Kirsten's time.  It has been very refreshing to see my daughter and her friends develop a deep interset in these books, role playing the characters, playing with the dolls, and learning about another time rather than pursuing the mindless, empty fluff of many things vying for a young girl's attention. Although some of Kirsten's experiences are a bit far-fetched (I.e. - not fearing a bear, having a pet racoon) the books' intrinsic value is not in the experiences, but rather in the history given in a light, fun way - what better way to learn than by having fun doing it.","parent_asin":"0937295760","timestamp":977517622000,"helpful_vote":30,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":3,"title":"Not as good as most","text":"I have read many books about special forces teams, Navy and others, over the past couple of years.  Luttrells first book is by far the best one I have every read.  This follow up to Lone Survivor was a disappointment.  It appeared to me that Marcus had less involvement with the content and that was the key reason I did not enjoy it.","parent_asin":"0316185361","timestamp":1349090040000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true}

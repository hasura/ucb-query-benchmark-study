You are working with two datasets to solve this query.

Here are the descriptions of these two datasets:

1. **indexinfo_dataset** {indexInfo_query.db}
   - This dataset is stored in a SQLite database and contains metadata about stock market indices from major exchanges around the world, including the United States, China, Canada, Germany, Japan, and more.
   - Fields:
     - Exchange (str): Full name of the stock exchange
     - Currency (str): Trading currency of the exchange

2. **indextrade_dataset** {indexTrade_query.db}
   - This dataset is stored in a DuckDB database and contains daily price data for indices tracking stock exchanges across various countries and regions.
   - Fields:
     - Index (str): Abbreviated index symbol
     - Date (str): Trading date
     - Open (float): Opening price
     - High (float): Highest price during the day
     - Low (float): Lowest price during the day
     - Close (float): Closing price
     - Adj Close (float): Adjusted closing price
     - CloseUSD (float): Closing price in USD

### Hint: The Exchange field in indexInfo_query.db contains full exchange names (e.g., "Tokyo Stock Exchange", "New York Stock Exchange"). The Index field in indexTrade_query.db contains abbreviated index symbols (e.g., "N225", "HSI", "000001.SS"). To join these datasets, you need to match exchange names with their corresponding major index symbols. For example, "Tokyo Stock Exchange" corresponds to "N225" (Nikkei 225), "Hong Kong Stock Exchange" corresponds to "HSI" (Hang Seng Index).
### Hint: The region (e.g., Asia, Europe, North America) of each stock exchange is not explicitly provided. You must infer the region using geographic knowledge. For instance, "N225" belongs to the Asia region because it tracks the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Japan.
### Hint: "Up days" refer to trading days where the closing price is higher than the opening price. "Down days" refer to trading days where the closing price is lower than the opening price.
### Hint: The term "average intraday volatility" refers to the average relative fluctuation of a stock index within each trading day. It is typically computed as (High - Low) / Open for each day, then averaged across a given time period.

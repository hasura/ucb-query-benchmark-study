I think you'd have to have a big interest in the topic to find it exciting, and kids would be bored. I think it only lasted maybe 10-15 minutes. Our tour person was somewhat knowledgeable and seemed into it, but he didn't give us much time to read the information on each level. I had to take photos of the plaques to read later, and half of them need replacing, as they are so sun-bleached they're virtually unreadable (tour guide said they're being replaced soon and that the other half were already replaced). I really thought it needed to be higher up to give a good view. The Lewis and Clark State Historic Site just down the road was more interesting and free.

I've purchased about 10 used cars in the last 25 years. This has been the worst experience by far. Test drove and purchased a used car on 3\/31 for my 16 year old daughter, the salesman knew it was for her. Bought the 3 year 'bumper to bumper' warranty the finance guy said was the same as if it \"just came off the showroom floor\". They needed to remove pin stripes and fix a tire pressure sensor so they agreed to deliver it; we live almost two hours away. Met them after dark near the highway on 4\/2; the check engine light came on on our way home. Texted a pic to the salesman and called him the next day -- no response. Left several voice mails for the warranty\/finance guy - no response. Took it to a friend at local dealer who hooked it up to the diagnostic machine and said it was the after-market high-flow air intake that caused the warning light. I would not have purchased the car had I known that. Then another warning light - reduced engine performance, reduce clutch use. To make a very long story short - clutch goes, daughter gets stranded on busy highway, vehicle towed back to Ford of Port Richey; lots of promises about fixing it and being at the front of the service line, zero follow up, 53 days of ownership, 31 days out of commission\/in shop and the story ends with a bill for $2000, even though they ultimately acknowledged one of their managers drove the car for three days because the check engine light kept coming on before they sold it. I won't even mention the cracked windshield we saw the morning after they delivered - just turn it in on your insurance. I understand it is free but still counts as a claim.

Oh yes..... you have to see it before believing it....\n\nWhen driving up here, I must admit: I felt a bit unsafe. I can't imagine this is one of Tampa's best neighbourhoods, so to speak. So I wasn't really sure what to expect... I had read beautiful reviews about this place, but while we were looking for it, meeeeeeh let's just say: ignore the surroundings and just go for it. It. Will. Get. Better!\n\nGram's Place is basically a hippie playground; it's a 'compound' filled with all sorts of kitschy knick-knacks form around the world, the atmosphere is uber-relaxed, the people that stayed there are mostly young travelers \/ backpackers and no worries: it's not a hostel that you have to share bunk beds with a whole group (only if you want to), but they have 'private rooms' as well. To be fair, that's a bit more up my alley....\n\nWe arrived quite late; Bruce (the owner) opened the door and is such a cool, genuinely nice host! And it felt I stepped into a musical Wonderland; the place is dedicated to the late singer\/songwriter Gram Parsons, so the whole atmosphere & all the rooms just breath 'music'; the rooms are musically themed (we stayed in the 'Jazz Room') and all the surroundings are just covered with musical instruments, sheets of music, CD \/ LP covers and what not. \n\nWe did some shopping at a local grocery store and used the BBQ; oh yes... there's a great BBQ at one of the patio's for everyone to use as they please! So I stood there, in the warm weather with a can of Miller's, baking my burgers & sausages and I felt like such a Bohemian traveller!  \n\nYes, to be fair, I gave it 5 stars as the service was great, the room was tidy & clean, we had our own little bathroom, the atmosphere was just brilliant and totally unexpected. I do realize, this is perhaps not for everyone.... if you're into posh hotels, this is not your thing. If you're up for uber privacy, then perhaps you need to stay in your room. If you're creeped out by the thought that you share a kitchen & you need to do your own dishes afterwards, this is not the place for you. \n\nFor me, I saw the beauty of it and I loved staying here.

I have never experienced harassment like this from a business EVER. When I refused to do so, they responded to my review saying I used a homophobic slur against them??? What kind of insane bullying tactic is this? I received private messages from Sheehan and James essentially throwing a tantrum because of my review, and apparently this comment was their last resort. I am an LGBTQ+ ally in every sense of the word, and I'm also a lawyer who works for an LGBTQ+ led company. I dedicate my pro bono time to LGBTQ+ initiatives. Shame on you - so many people ACTUALLY experience discrimination solely based on their sexual orientation and you throwing accusations every time you *don't get your way* is disrespectful to the entire community. \n\nBelow is what I said to him on the phone, but for some reason this is how he wants to handle the situation publicly. I also wasn't going to include this update, but I don't want anyone else to experience what we went through. In the days after returning from grooming, my puppy was itching nonstop. We decided to give her a bath even though she just got \"groomed\", and when her fur was wet we saw that she was COVERED in fleas. This is a 4 month old puppy that has been inside 100% of the time and not around any other dogs, and somehow she returns from this grooming session with fleas??? After washing everything in our house, using medicated shampoo, and combing through her fur, we finally were able to get rid of the infestation. Where was she when the groomer was on his many smoke breaks? In a dirty crate? I'm sure they didn't expect me to be in my car out front watching the whole time. Beware!!\n\n******\n\nI struggled with writing this review because this is a small business and the owner seems very nice. This is review is about James, the groomer, in particular. My puppy visited for the first time today - she's 4 months old and this is her second grooming session. Her first groomer is 45 min away, and Pit Stop HQ was a closer option. \n\nWhen I dropped my puppy off, James seemed like he couldn't be bothered listening to what I wanted for the cut. I wrestled with leaving her with him at all, because my gut told me he wasn't going to handle her with care. They said it would be about an hour to an hour and a half, so I decided to wait out front in my car, especially given my uneasiness. Within 5 minutes, James was outside on a smoke break. Ok, fine...everyone needs breaks. Over an hour later, I watched him come out again for another smoke break, then he disappeared down the block. I walked into the shop wondering where my dog was while he's taking a stroll...5 minutes later he comes back and says another hour! I don't think he had even started on my dog the whole time I was waiting in my car outside. \n\nDespite my annoyance, I told him to take his time so it was done right. Ten minutes later I got a call saying she was all done. I didn't get a chance to look that closely until I got in the car, but the cut was SO choppy and she looked absolutely terrible. He definitely rushed and didn't care at all about how she looked. I even told him at drop off that we have family portraits scheduled for tomorrow, and now I have to cancel the session. I was really hoping to get pictures done while she was still a small puppy, but I have to wait until her hair grows out again. I don't even care about the $60 I spent - I could just tell my puppy wasn't treated with respect or dignity from my interactions with James.\n\nI spent an hour bribing her with treats when I got home to fix the uneven cut. The picture below is after struggling to fix it - it was much worse before. The picture with the yellow bow is her last grooming session with someone else. I never write bad reviews, especially because it can hurt small businesses...but this experience was too awful not to share. Take a look at the pictures and you be the judge!","date":1595017836000}

I bought my truck tires here and they come with FREE lifetime rotation, road hazard AND balancing. I'm always curb checking, throwing balancing weights off, running over nails or something. I've never had an issue with walking out of here charged zero for any tire related stuff. Same today. My Bill = zero and the tires = balanced and rotated. They've even completely replaced tires for me because there was a defect or something. Outstanding techs and front desk managers. Very helpful, honest and good people. They almost always nail their time and estimate. \n\nProblem: Service manager. \nHe doesn't look like any other dobbs employee (because he's actually a salesman working you for the upsell) and emerges from his office in the shop area. His office is back there, you know, so you can't question his credibility. He is the seemingly innocent, helpful guy that tells you there is something else wrong with your vehicle. This is usually done when he feels you haven't spent enough money with them that day. In particular on your routine FREE tire maintenance or FREE oil changes. I've probably been coming here for 10 years and every time the Service Manager tries to upsell me something. You must refuse his power. Otherwise your FREE visit will become a $300+ visit.\n\nI do this, then I take my truck to my mechanic and he laughs, telling me here's only the parts you really need. He says let me guess, service manager at dobbs again? It's usually 50-75% less than what the dobbs service manager quotes and usually half the parts and labor time.\n\nAgain 5 stars to the front desk managers and auto techs.","date":1475114475000}

She is also the only reason I put up with the atrocious customer service at this location and unfair charges for so long. I have been having issues with the app not booking me in classes, showing me as not in classes I am booked in, and not cancelling classes I cancelled in time. This has resulted in several disputable charges on my account. Each time I called I was told there were no other reported issues with the app and I must be mistaken. And that if there was an issue with the app, they are just a franchise and the app is owned and ran by orange theory not the franchise location. This went on for months and to be perfectly honest I thought maybe I was mistaken. Last week I was booked in Kelly's 10 am Saturday class and I screenshotted it in the app as booked and screenshotted it in my calendar (as this is also done via the app). I was on the wait list and often check my wait list number throughout the week. On Friday when I went to see if I had been bumped up, I was no longer booked in the class. When I called to ask them about the app, she told me I was still on the wait list as number 2. At this point I flipped out because had I not called I would have just found another workout for that morning assuming I was again mistaken AGAIN and thus \"no showed\" thinking I wasn't booked in the class when I was. Thus, resulting in a charge for a class I \"no showed\", when in reality the app is not providing accurate info but I am making decisions as though it is. Thank god I screenshotted it or else they could have continued dodging me and saying I am mistaken. I asked Emily if I could please have a number to speak with someone at orange theory about the app issues. After being on hold for 10 minutes she came back and said that the manager would call me. It has been almost a week and no call. I am cancelling my membership today, but if you want good customer service, accountability, and you don't want to be robbed blind, I suggest you use a different orange theory location. I am genuinely upset about this because like I said, Kelly is worth the bullshit because she is such an amazing trainer. They are lucky to have her and most people probably put up with their bullshit because of her. I will probably pay the higher \"drop in fee\" to get my Kelly fix, but I won't let them have access to any of my cards via a membership. They will take your money with zero remorse as to whether you or their app caused the issue. They don't care.","date":1475083158000}

When I purchased these stairs, there were no reviews online except the positive testimonials on the company's webpage. I figure it's worth it to put a more honest description out there based on my very negative experience. \n\nI ordered custom stairs from The Iron Shop over a month ago. Red flags went up immediately. When drafting up a quote for me, my sales rep made multiple silly mistakes - the wrong number of treads, wrong floor-to-floor height used for calculations, etc. He would cover these mistakes by saying things like \"the computer automatically does this.\" It seemed outrageous to me that the customer (I'm a physician; I have absolutely no experience in stair construction!) had to point out these errors to someone whos job it is to make and oversee these calculations. \n\nSecond, the sales rep told me that the stairs should arrive within 2 weeks. I scheduled my contractor based on these expectations, and it is now 4 weeks later and we still do not have all the parts. \n\nThirdly, the handrails arrived cracked and the central stair beam arrived scratched and rusted. This is not because of the shipper; The Iron Shop packed the material very carelessly and did not use any protective gear. All of the spindles are scratched in some way or another. When I called my sales rep to report this, he said he would replace the handrails in 2 weeks (that long for a piece of wood?). More ridiculously, he said that he cannot do anything about the central beam - if I wanted to I could just \"paint over the scratches.\" Furthermore, he said that my expectations for the central beam were unreasonable. I'm sorry if I expect a product I paid over $2000 for to arrive without scratches and rust. I put my contractor on the phone with him, and he basically told us that he cannot serve as our sales rep any further because he \"has had enough.\" This is horrible customer service.\n\nFinally, the shippers that the company uses are perhaps even more unreliable than The Iron Shop. NewPenn told me twice that they would deliver at a certain time. I had to leave patients at the hospital to be home at that time, and no one arrived BOTH times. This is completely irresponsible. \n\nI finally was re-routed to the owner\/manager who took things into his own hands and got the final products to me. I'm sorry, but a customer should not have to go through all of this trouble just to get the items I paid for. \n\nMy contractor and I would never recommend The Iron Shop to anyone.

I went in recently to purchase some things, and item I wanted did not have a price I had found a similar item I wanted (wanting both) took both up to the front. One you could tell was more expensive (better quality, had a price tag and a sensor) I was informed the other item would be more expensive. I asked where the the person at the counter came up with that number as she did not look up anything, or call for an associate. She said it's a default amount. I asked if she was a manager since usually managers override prices. She said she wasn't (Val never informed me she was a supervisor). So I asked for corporates number to ask policy cause the associate didn't even try to look for it.\nI was given the store I was at number. I called and spoke to a manager named angel who told me that there policy is to get a Sales associate to go and look for a price or you could bring up a similar item. If a similar item is not found they have different skus (that they can use for generic prices). I told her I brought over almost the exact same item and she wouldn't accept that. She said it has to be the same brand, I told her that's not what you said to me.  She then informed me that items with sensors are more expensive. This didn't make sense as the item with a sensor had a price and it was less then she was telling me the other item (missing a tag) would be. She then tried to tell me its cause they didn't have any other staff to go look. I told the manager again that did not make sense because  I spoke to 2 sales associates on the floor, a loss prevention employee, the supervisor who was my checkout girl and the manager.  She said every issue is different. I then  asked for corporates number again because at this time the manager was not being helpful. She gave me Ross gift card number. I went back in and asked for it again where angel (the manager) told me that was the only number she had and I would need to call them and have them help me. The gift card people don't even work for Ross! The 2 normal associates I spoke to were nice and tried to help, the management and supervisors are not able to communicate policy properly, the management continued to change what they were saying but all I wanted to know was policy. The transaction was handled properly after speaking to corporate Ross but unfortunately Angel the manager didn't seem to know procedure so she was unable to communicate it properly making it look as if a supervisor didn't do what she was suppose to do. Also if a customer asks for a corporate number that's what they should be given they shouldn't be told to go and find it.","date":1501220612000}

Nice work. \n\nAll in all, I believe we tried 3 salads and 4 entrees. Everything we tried was scrumptious.

Invoice says payment due in 30 days -- he places lien and files in court after 7 days.\n\nWhile I was in Michigan I received a phone call saying there was water in my neighbor's Florida condo which was coming from my unit next-door.  I hadn't been in my condo for months and had no idea what the situation was.  I called Mr. Dry Out and asked if he could take a look.\n\nWhen Mr. Dry Out arrived and called it was clear from his description that water was present for a long time causing extensive damage.  Among other things he specifically mentioned that he would charge an insurance company $4000 to $5000 to remediate the damages which were so extensive that the unit was not fit for sale, that walls needed to be removed, and that mold could extend four feet high.\n\nI said that I was very familiar with construction and would leave the next morning to drive down, but that my immediate concern was to stop any water from entering my neighbor's unit.  Mr. Jerabek  became extremely difficult to deal with.  I became concerned and called several times to say that all I wanted was to protect the adjacent unit.  He said that there was much that needed to be done and he would continue to do all that he wanted to protect his reputation.  I wanted to tell him to leave my place, but felt I couldn't due to the need to safeguard my neighbors.  He eventually left after several hours.\n\nTwo days later I arrived to find that the description I had received was completely false.  There was no mold and it was obvious that there had not been any.  All the furniture was in excellent condition, the walls were just as when we left months ago, nothing had been damaged by water.  I was shocked!  It was readily apparent that the water had not been in our unit for an extended time and only recently when a worker turned on the main shutoff valve outside our unit had a leaking faucet in the bathroom -- immediately adjacent to my neighbors -- caused the floor to be wet.\n\nThough I had said that I would do any needed work on my unit, Mr. Jerabek had removed carpet throughout my condo, tore off tiles, ripped up tack strip, and removed trim.  None of which I wanted or needed, and none of which had anything to do with protecting my neighbor.  I feel fortunate that my strong protestations on the phone hindered him from doing even more destruction.  From my condo I called Mr. Dry Out and told him we needed to discuss his work.  He refused to meet and threatened legal action.  \n\nAfter returning to Michigan I received a bill in the mail for twice the amount he had quoted which called for payment within 30 days. After only seven days I received notice that a lien had been place on my property and a suit filed in small claims court.\n\nThe judge gave him half of what he was seeking.","date":1595356592000}

We were contacted by the \"manager\" who indicated they were running a bit behind and that they would be arriving closer to the end of the window. At the end of the window we were told that they \"unexpectedly\" had to move an entire house before ours and that they could not make it until 10 PM. At 10:30 we were contacted again and advised they were still not finished and that they expected they would be done around 11. We have a toddler who needed her crib the same night. The movers did not arrive until 12:30 AM. Poor time management and communication. Inexcusably unprofessional. At the very least, a straightforward and honest request to push the move to the next day when they knew they could not make it even remotely close to on time would have been appreciated so alternative measures could have been taken for sleeping arrangements. This company created unnecessary stress for my husband and I, and even worse made our move even more difficult for our 1 year old daughter. Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere for moving services.","date":1500181375000}

On a Saturday (prime shopping day for most), they don't seem to staff the deli and meat counter with enough people.  In the deli you can wait 5 to 10 minutes watching staff making food and filling the food cases but they do not have the responsibility to wait on customers.  Likewise in the meat dept. you can see 3 pr 4 people cutting meat but only one person waiting on customers.  On average customers waiting at meat market want 3 to 4 items.

An average meal will be about 5~6 items for 2 adults.  Maybe we didn't order the right dishes.  Regardless, our check still came up to be about $77 before tips (including 1 beer).\n\nWhile I like to give credit to restaurants that supports the locavore movement, I also expect the WOW factor if they are charging a premium for it.  And believe me, we've had simple dishes before that was great.\n\nBottomline is, average tasting food at a premium price point.  Service was good though.","date":1332477569000}

I had an idea of what I wanted but I'm so out of the loop on this stuff. Christina was super great doing my pedicure. I kept apologizing because I don't ever get my nails done and she was so sweet and made me comfortable. I also had an ingrown toenail on my big toe that was causing me some pain from where I dug at it and had weird growth.  She explained she could help me make it feel better and start growing normally again. She did just that without causing any extra pain and she made the entire pedicure process enjoyable!!! \n\n       I made my appointment through Facebook and due to being out of the loop I just said a manicure. Not dip or gel. I wanted dip but didn't know I had to specify. Turns out I needed to. John, the owner, came up to me and explained that there's only 2 techs out of the 3 that can do dip while Christina can do gel and regular polish. He was very stern with me about explaining that to them because they are so short staffed which took me aback a little, but I also understand it was my fault for not specifying. Other than that little hiccup, they took great care of me. And I'm very happy and will be returning! \n\n\nIf anyone is wondering about prices it's like normal manicure\/pedicure cost.

I was not going to hire a\nMold remediation company until I knew how had the money to pay for the services . \n\nI became very very sick from the mold in my home and I almost died in it . My pup was gasping for air . We had to stay with friends . I am a stroke survivor my immune systems weak form the mold I could barley stand  but the night before the remediation work I pulled all my clothes towels and linens from the condo . My body would not allow me to do any more . \n\nAs for hiring a plumber and electrician before remediation was absolutely never discussed . I asked them to save door knobs and and anything else we could salvage . They thought I was ridiculous and did not want to be bothered . \n\nI hired the Mr Dry Out company to remove mold from my condo . It is now April 20 2017 . While working with a licensed subcontractor we discovered mold on a bathroom wall today . \n\nJerabek from Mr Dry Out was trying to talk me out of a post test telling me I could not afford it . I ask  . Who is he to determine what I can afford or not ? He sent me to a home inspector who lost the samples for 3 weeks  . I never demanded he do his scotch tape test . I thought the procedure seemed  dumb . He only did that because he wanted to get paid stating he was behind on his mortgage. He followed me all the way to Largo he was so desperate for the  payment . \n\nAfter Mr Dry Out did his scotch tape test which I thought was stupid  , then sent his home inspector who claimed my home was mold Free . . I also know Mr Dry Out and the home inspector spoke before test . I have no proof the  sample was taken at my home the second time .i was living off site . After the remediation company paid I became extremely sick in the condo . I reached out to the home inspector who had nothing to say and Jerabek became nasty about it . \n\nWhen I tried to reach out to Jerabek to tell him the concerns I have expecting he would take on a professional attitude and make things right . Instead of cooperation I was met with a narcissistic bully . Jerabek began making threats . He also posted on his business Facebook page my full name and video of my condo in its devastation without my permission. He had people calling me names and when I tried to defend myself he blocked me from responding . \n\nMr Dry Out keeps throwing around about his satisfaction  paperwork .. I ask what good is if if when he does not accomplish what he was hired to do which was to remove mold from my home . I became so sick after his work ( Moldy mattress left behind mold under the  kitchen tile and mold left in bathroom wall ) I became so sick because he did not complete his work nor would he stand behind his mistakes . His lack of truth in the things he is saying speaks volumes about his Character or lack of it . This man had zero integrity","date":1495304896000}

We heard about it through the lonely planet and the review prepared us for a quirky hostel......but quirky does not begin to describe this one of a kind experience. I would urge anyone, whether on a budget or not, to swing by grams place. \n\nThe over all theme is music, but within each corner of this eccentric connection of structures are many themes...from the 1950's 'i love lucy' kitchen (complete with antique stove and features), to the hawaiian kitsch, fairy lit, pink flamingo lined garden decking with jacuzzi. We stayed in the rock and roll room in the main house, complete with en suite, wifi and tv. Cheap enough for those on a budget and a comfortable and sociable lodging experience for those more luxurious travellers. There are also dorm rooms for those on a shoestring budget. \n\nOn the other side of the house there is an alternative modern shared kitchen and t.v lounge with all the expected amenities and comforts of a home from home. Laundry facilities are also available.\n\nThe place was packed out when we were there, people from all over the world chatted over beers in the jacuzzi, swapping travelling stories and advice. The owner was on hand to dish out beers, keep the music playing and help organise kayaking trips and outings to the beautiful beaches nearby, and if you need a timeout from the chat, you can escape to adventurous roof decking for a quiet moment.\n\nGrams place is ideal for travellers looking for something more sociable and homely than the hotel\/motel downtown...........enjoy!","date":1295655288000}

Yes, the neighborhood is a little sketch but it's YBOR! The whole place is sketchy, that's the fun of it... But the hostel is NOT unsafe in any way, there are security cameras all over the premises inside and out, the property is extremely secure.\n\nNow for my review:\nThis is THE BEST hostel I have EVER visited. This place is a dream! The decor is a cluttered collection,  a vast array of junk treasure that will have your eyes wandering constantly. My sister and I stayed for 3 days and 2 nights and couldn't have had a better time. The staff and owners were EXTREMELY accommodating and super fun to hang out with. We went to tampa\/ybor\/st pete for the specific purpose of going to a concert and planned on staying for a little extra time to go out a couple nights to bars\/clubs close by, but this place was so fun and the people were so chill that we actually preferred to stay there and party instead.

This is a very hip Manayunk location with a gorgeous flowing staircase inside. Parking is ample across the street but for events you may even be given free valet service! (We were but elected to park our car in the lot) \n\nAs soon as we arrived an attendant took my dripping wet umbrella & bagged it for me and set it in the umbrella holder. We were greeted with servers carrying trays of cocktails and wine. From what I understand the venue does not supply the wine but they do create the amazing appetizers and legendary meals.\n\nThe appetizers kept on coming and coming, scallops wrapped w bacon, huge Japanese shrimp wrapped in a wonton thing, cheesesteak egg rolls, \"green eggs and ham\"- they were  deviled egg filling dyed green on a tiny piece of toast with a tiny piece of ham, mini mussels with bacon, grilled salmon, mini steak tartar on a mini toast, and mini salads in a Parmesan cheese crispy \"bowl\".  They had hot melted Brie with fig  jam it was amazing along with a cheese table with seeded crackers.  I would have been happy with just the appetizers.\n\nThe entree we ordered was a splendid melt in your mouth filet mignon for my husband and a huge crab cake for me accompanied by mashed potatoes, and asparagus. Omg then after desserts which was cake and mini pastries served in a separate room downstairs.  After the desserts they brought out curly fries and ketchup!\n\nThe service from the staff was spectacular and everything, like the appetizers, was plentiful! We were treated like royalty. The young man, the wedding coordinator, kept everything moving and took control of the well paced event. They're obvious professionals with lots of experience executing these events.\n\nThe roof was leaking during the event in one small spot and the rain was brutal that evening.

I do not like going to the dentist. I despise a dental visit as much as going to buy a car. For one, a car salesperson can be outright rude and dishonest, as sneaky as a snake. It seems that dentistry is becoming the same way. They want to sell you their fillings and teeth replacements as much as possible. As well, (ahem Arnold Dental Center), the dental assistants like to play macabre torture games with their appliances.\nDr. Allan has done nothing of the sort. I feared, because of previous visits at ADC, that I had bad dental caries, one that required a root canal and a crown. After doing a few x-rays at this dental office, Dr. Allan said that I had no such cavities and he set me up for a dental cleaning, which was sorely needed. \nBy the way, since I was a veteran, Dr. Allan cleaned my teeth for free. Yes, free! He has one day per year so that veterans can come into his office and get free dental services. This man is not just a good dentist, he's a certified Saint! \nIf you have a future appointment, keep it. If you need dental services, seek this man right away!

Also it is close to bus lines, but the neighborhood is not located in any tourist area, although there is a small park next door.-- NOT recommended for families with young children. But 2 people can easily share a private room for $60 or a single can get a bunk in a shared dorm for @$ 25. There are all kinds of little nooks to sit on the small property with a book and relax.

This situation was handled so poorly and I do plan on following thru with whatever complaints I can,  Not everyone is an addict, some people want to live with less pain and live a normal life.  Isnt that my right?\nI have tried to speak to the office manager, didnt get very far.  As for a note from Dr. Lerman, i have made many attempts, at this point im done argueing but I have notified my lawyer and other doctors.  This is not how you treat people.  Oh and because I referred people in the past, thats a red flag too.. Are you people in the speciality of pain management or not?","date":1504801360000}

The decision to go was a last minute one and that's not easy to accomplish at Farmhaus due to their popularity and the few number of seats in the house. However, to my pleasant surprise, after a few phone calls and some shuffling on the part of the management staff, Miles was able to accommodate our party of eight with just a minor shift in our arrival time. No problem! We can be flexible since the staff was working so hard to get us in. Miles' attention and superb customer service did not go unnoticed. And...we were seated immediately upon arriving!\n\nThis was the first visit to Farmhaus for all eight of us. Around the table, we had 3 bottles of wine ($40 and up), a couple of offerings by the glass, the Farmhaus Butcher's Plate ($28), Seafood Gumbo ($10), Porchetta Bao ($11), Braised Goat Shank ($14), Gulf Triggerfish ($23) x 3, Meatloaf ($23) x 2, Blackfin Tuna ($24) and Dry Aged Ribeye ($37) x 2. We did not have dessert.\n\nThe overall concensus was the same: Butcher's Plate - AWESOME! Goat Shank - very good. Porchetta Bao - AWESOME! The Triggerfish was very good and so was the Blackfin Tuna. The meatloaf is one of their specialties so we were expecting it to blow us away. It did not, but it was very good. It's very smokey in flavor and, on this night, somewhat dry. The gumbo is advertised as \"soon to be famous\" but my personal opinion is that is has a long way to go to make that claim. The Ribeye was average. But I'm being overly picky since we eat at so many great places. Portions were appropriate in our group opinion.\n\nThe reality is this is a place everyone should try! It's quaint, the staff is great (including our server and all support staff that we encountered), Miles is wonderful and will one day be running his own house (my prediction!), the wine list is short but very well thought out. The Butcher's Plate is something everyone should try; it's truly an adventure for your taste buds! The Porchetta Bao is such a surprise as the tastes are delightful. Additionally, I'd say try their seafood as our group found the seafood entrees to be the best of the offerings we tried. Lastly, they were attentive to any food-specific needs such as allergies. While we had no such concerns, it was very nice to be asked ahead of time. Again, very attentive service.\n\nOverall, it's a great place! We will go back.\n\nSide notes: Not great for kids or overly large groups (more than 8). Dress should be business casual, although I saw people I thought were under-dressed. Just my opinion. :)","date":1444000120000}

The quality of their diamonds is absolutely remarkable but it is the quality of service that is unlike any other. John, Helene and Stephanie are simply the best. They are all so helpful, kind and extremely genuine.\n\nMy now Fiance, Kevin, once asked me what kind of ring I liked while watching a cheesy rom com. I nearly died of excitement, went on Pinterest, found a picture of my dream ring and sent it to him. We never talked about it again - until the day he proposed! I later found out that Kevin took that one photo to John and they both worked on custom designing it together. I was in awe when I saw it because it was a way better version of the ring I showed Kevin. John also took the time to explain cut, clarity and color to Kevin. This has made Kevin an expert when it comes to evaluating other peoples' rings because we know that we got the best of the best :)\n\nKevin and I went to the shop together because I had to get my ring resized. I walked through the door and immediately felt like I was part of the family. I was welcomed with such warmth and happiness. I was just in between sizes and John was kind enough to recommend two sizing beads which allowed the diamond to fall perfectly on my finger.

This is an insane workout.  You do 15 minutes of \"warm up\" which I put in quotes only because for most people this \"Warm Up\" will put them on the floor sucking wind.  After that, you are given 1 minute to put your gloves on and begin a 3 minutes, 8 round session where you follow the instructors command on hits.  This portion, you honestly get what you put into it.

But first, I'd like to address the one negative review written by a person who clearly has never actually stayed at Gram's: \n\nRe: the customer service complaints - I had some issues with my reservation (dates and such) and didn't realize until a week before I was scheduled to arrive. I gave them a call and everything was fixed within a minute. They were professional and courteous the entire time. Had this been at a hotel instead, it would have taken a lot longer to resolve my issue and it more than likely would have cost me money. Quit grasping at straws. Some people will complain about anything. \n\nRe: the \"safety issue\" - complaining Gram's is unsafe because you feel the area is unsafe is ridiculous. To rate this place 1 star based on how you feel about the neighborhood is unfair, especially when you have not stayed there. Based on my experience, I can assure the rest of you Gram's is 100% safe. They have security cameras, security codes and locks on nearly every door, and also work hard to ensure their guests are comfortable at all times even if that means getting rid of guests that make other people uncomfortable or ruin their experience. They work very hard to maintain a relaxed, vacation-y vibe and go about it perfectly.\n\nWhile Gram's is clearly open and accepting of all types of people from all walks of life, it's clear it is not the place for everybody. Especially uppity types that are looking for 5-star luxurious accommodations on the cheap. \n\nOn to my review!\n\nWe were in town for a music festival and found this place online. The reviews were stellar we decided to extend our stay in order to enjoy Gram's to the fullest cause it was so obviously our cup of tea. One of the best decisions I've ever made in my life!\n\nThe owner, Bruce, is awesome - very hospitable! He told us about a million and one things to do in Tampa within the first 7 min of us being there. Bruce and house mum Christine provided us with rides most of the times we needed to get anywhere which was totally unexpected and extremely appreciated! It was honestly like staying with family.\n\nThe inn is eccentric and cozy. I felt right at home. The decor is fascinating, you always find something new with every scan of the place. There are lots of areas to just kick it and socialize with everyone but everybody tends to gravitate towards the outdoor bar\/hot tub area which is well equipped with seating, fans, a stereo system, a TV, the whole nine yards. Basically how I wish my backyard looked.\n\nWe stayed in the Amsterdam room for 25 bucks a night. I didn't really spend much time up there, just to sleep, so I don't really have much to say. The room itself, bedding, and bathroom were all clean, no complaints whatsoever. \n\nThe overall vibe of the place is extremely chill and laidback. I've never felt THIS comfortable surrounded by strangers. Met so many awesome people, everyone I met during my stay I felt I knew my entire life! And by sheer luck, some of the other guests we met at Gram's happened to be in town for the same reason as us, so we all ended up going together and enjoying the festival in a group. Also had the pleasure of meeting Maggie, the resident dog, who is the most adorable, food-loving penguin-pup I've ever met. \n\nI've always said the people you meet during your travels make the difference between a pleasant trip and the perfect trip. I'm lucky to have had the latter. I can't tell you how happy I am to have ended up here and to have had the opportunity to meet people from all over the world, and experience the festival and other parts of Florida with my Gram Fam. This is the sort of experience a hotel\/motel cannot offer no matter how hard they try. I will say, however, the one issue I have with Gram's is that I know no other hostel I ever stay at will ever hold a candle to Gram's.\n\nThank you Gram Fam for the unforgettable experience! I had such an amazing time and I can't wait to come back!!","date":1431552048000}

I have been looking for a hair salon in Philadelphia since moving to the city. I was looking forward to trying the Philadelphia Hair Studio after purchasing a Groupon for this salon. However, my interactions -- and even lack of interactions -- with the professionals at this salon leaves much to be desired. I called and left voicemails for a week before I heard from a human being -- Michael himself did call me back. I scheduled an appointment for the following week after work. Less than one hour before that appointment Michael had texted me requesting a reschedule. I found it odd that he texted me to reschedule, let alone did so less than one hour before my appointment time. I was pretty bummed and slightly mad but I did not hold resentment towards the salon -- I get that things happen. I asked for a reschedule in the same text-based conversation in which Michael asked if he could reschedule me. His reply was \"ok...\" but he never confirmed a date\/time, or even offered scheduling options. So, after several days and checking the Yelp page for this business I called the studio some more. Finally, I got to the point where I had no patience and felt if the business could text me on a last minute cancel I could text to request an appointment. Apparently the Philadelphia Hair Studio is not open on Tuesday -- despite what Yelp says -- and they are overwhelmed. He could not book me, offer a time, or anything until the following day at which he would call me to let me know when I could have an appointment. Sadly, my life cannot be put on pause for a hair appointment -- I am a research and transplant professional, so waiting for a call about hair cut is pretty laughable. And considering the track history I had in such a short period with poor communication I did not trust the promise of calling tomorrow to set an appointment. Additionally, I aired my frustrations in the most polite manners about the lack of communication, which was answered by his own feelings of being overwhelmed by Groupon. We shared one thing in common -- regret. He regretted signing up with Groupon and I regretted purchasing his Groupon. Luckily I contacted Groupon and they issued a refund to me. I hope Philadelphia Hair Studio is less overwhelmed by the loss of a potential customer. I really doubt the professionalism within this business, but maybe they are understaffed. Who knows, but I do not recommend this place at all. Customer Service should not be a text message with a last minute cancellation because he forgets his kid's birthday.","date":1415138390000}

They claim to be highly rated but are not a reputable company. They are heartless and cut throat. These people seemed to be very nice over the phone, but absolutely care nothing about you or your belongings. \n  I hired this company to move my 60 year old mother who has a neurological disorder. Myself and my mother arranged a time with them. They showed up an hour earlier than the discussed time and then proceeded to call myself and my mother liars about discussed time. \n  They told me they could provide me with free overnight storage, but neglected to tell me that we would be charged the hourly rate loading the things into and out of the storage. So what was initially a $400 move turned into a $1800 move. Which is insane because my move literally moved 10 minutes down the road.\n  One of the boxes my mother had labeled \"banks\" with my nieces piggy banks inside, was broken into. I notified the company and they took 0 blame for the incident and blamed the geriatric community that my mother had moved into. \n  They didn't unload things into my moms different rooms, they unloaded everything into her hallway right past her door. So my mother under up moving it all around herself. \n  Worst part was my mother's television was cracked and broken. She asked the movers to wrap it differently and they insisted on storing it in their own way. When she got it she notified the crew that it had a bubble on the screen. They told her not to worry about it. Once she turned the tv on, it was completely broken and the screen inside cracked very badly. They refused to do anything about it bc there was no documentation that anything had happened when she received her items, even though I explained that she notified the delivery driver and that the internal screen damage was only noticeable once you turned it on. \n  They took 0 accountability for any of these things. I overpaid to the tune of 1800 for a short distance move. Every issue I had with them they responded to but with \"it's not our fault\" in long emails. These people are obviously accustomed to dealing with these issues and have gotten quite good at it. I paid $1800 to have my mothers belongings broken into and her tv crushed. Lesson learned, do a bit more research before you hire a moving company. Had I seen these negative reviews before I may have saved myself alote of grief.","date":1568390239000}

And Suppa was one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood - I would go around telling people who great it was, how everyone should eat there for the perfectly cooked food and the amazing flavors. An easy 5-star Yelp establishment. I haven't been to Samwich since it rebranded because I'm not a big night-time sandwich person but was feeling in the mood last night so I finally wandered over.\n\nHow can so many things go so wrong in such a simple order? I got the fried chicken sandwich with a side of fries. The fries were limp and sad. The bun was dry. The skin on the chicken was oily and moist, not remotely crisp. The chicken itself was okay - not moist but not dry I guess - but had a big chunk of fat (tendon? that white stuff that is rubbery) so that I could not bite into it. The flavors were muddled. I ended up not even eating a quarter of the sandwich which is pretty rare for me.\n\nI don't know how the quality could fall so far. If this were the first time I had been to this restaurant, there is absolutely no way I would go back. As it is, I know what the chef is capable of so I might return... but this meal was pretty bad.","date":1475413134000}

First off another reviewer said that Farmhaus is over rated and expensive and I have to agree,  I read the menu and coudn't find anything i really wanted to eat.  However the place is original, interesting and the plates artistic in presentation.  They use lots of pork, pork belly, sausage and bacon not a place if you are keeping kosher.  We tried the mushroom salad and spinach salad both had some form of pork too.  Mushroom salad was good and so was the spinach but not outstanding or worthy of 10-12 bucks because of small portions.  We also had the fish spread.  Nice smoked fish but with too much cream cheese (goat cheese)  Lavish was great.  My wife had the parrot fish, a small serving blackened with crawfish and you guessed it bacon.  I had the breakfast, 3 very small silver dollar corn cakes with sausage, pork belly and an egg (more pork).  I started to feel sorry for piggy.  All the dishes were beautifully presented, a work of art.  We spent a hundred bucks for 2 and left hungry.\n\nAdditionally they have a great wine list but the wine service was sub par.  My wife inquired about corkage and handed our pinot noir bottle to the server yet she served me not my wife the taste in small chardonnay glasses, we had to ask for red wine glasses.  We watched as they served other tables red wine with small wine glasses too.  Really they have an outstanding list too. This is a real disservice to the wine.\n\n We also watched a two top come in, sit down and read the menu only to leave immediately.  guess it wasnt their place either.","date":1362628726000}

The service team that I met with was understanding and kind in regards to the issue. I left my car with them for the day so that they could figure out the issue. They called me later with an update, and the guy that called was nice. He told me that it would cost $95 due to an aftermarket bulb that was causing an issue. I understood, and went to pick up my car about an hour later. Initial start of the engine on dealership property, I hear a loud grinding noise coming from the engine bay. I pop the hood and see that one of my braided hoses is grinding against my head unit belt. Stiff braided hose is relatively hard to move and usually stays in place. I saw that there were some front electrical connectors that they must have undone and moved the hose, causing it to rub against the belt. This could have been simple human error, but to not stop the car after they started the car and see what was causing the engine bay to shake came across as careless. I walked in and paid $95 and left with another problem to take care of. I'll probably replace the hose even though it luckily wasn't torn apart completely. I'll also probably have to get a Procharger dealer to check the head unit on my car to make sure no damage occurred. Head units are worth a good chunk of change, so I hope no damage occurred for my own sake. Better safe than sorry. Needless to say, I'm pretty disappointed. I probably won't take my car back.

He doesn't have his phone, he doesn't understand how uber really works and takes several minutes to play with his device to start the fare. However, before we left the development he got it going. Wasn't sure how to get me to my destination so I kindly let him use my GPS. No issue with the driver, again, he was super nice!\nI get my receipt $25. Sounds right. I just took uber into the city a week before and it cost the same.\nNext day I get an email telling me they have charged me an additional 8.50 because there was an issue. The new receipt attached showed a completely different fare than the ride I took. It showed us driving 6 miles for over an hour in a different neighborhood. So obviously I emailed back and said No way! This is wrong. \nThe response was the same as before. A generic email telling me there was an issue and the fare has been corrected to compensate the driver. Again I replied and said but I don't understand these charges, please explain. I gave them my exact pick up and drop off locations and times. The reply was a breakdown of the fare charges. Which made sense once the correct destinations were there. I said it was fine, I have no issue with paying extra money but I'd like to understand what the issue was that prevented this from being my original charge. Again, no real explanation. I ask for the contact info of a supervisor because I felt charging me was not the right thing to do since either uber or the driver had an issue.\n\nHEATHER- one of the most unprofessional, rude and condescending customer service reps emails me back. \n\nWhy this woman feels she should be in the customer service business is beyond me. \n\nSeveral emails back and forth where she is basically telling me this is the charge and that's that! The driver drove you so you're going to pay. It's not ubers fault you didn't leave yourself enough time to get to your destination. \nI said from start to finish the process took me an hour and a half when it should've taken 20 min tops! Her response was to explain to me what an ETA means. And that an hour and a half is normal. She refused to let me file a formal complaint. Bottom line, when you charge your customers one price and YOU as a company messed it up, YOU the company should eat the cost. If I had done something to create the discrepancy I could totally understand. But you should never take it upon yourself to abuse the permissions you've been given with someone's credit card! I will never use Uber again and I cannot wait until they're out of business. Heather needs to find a job on a farm or in the sewers where she has no customer interaction.\nJudging from other reviews, this is acceptable customer service as far as Uber is concerned.","date":1450206616000}

Of course, they will be glad to sell you ammo and other accessories.

I had never heard of the town, much less the towers.   We had planned on visitng the Childrens Museum in Edwardsville, then the Mississippi\/Missouri confluence site.  It turns out there are three ways to see the confluence of these rivers:  The Confluence State Park in West Alton, MO where you can walk out to the point; the Columbia Conservation area, where you can supposedly view the rivers from the south., then these confluence towers on the Illinois side.   \n  \nThis is about 3 miles north of 270 on Rte 3.  The towers themselves were pretty impressive, and they give a nice view of the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi, as well as a view of downtown, Clayton and Alton on a clear day.   The cost is $4 for adults, $2 for children.  There is an elevator that stops at three points on the tower.  \n\nThe trip up the towers is presented as a guided tour, where you learn a little bit about the area and the view.   The tour guide was knowledgeable, not to mention cute and perky.  I noticed the next group was led by a 60ish man who was neither cute nor perky.  \n\nThere is also a small interpretive center.  \n\nThis was a nice little excursion for us, especially when coupled with a visit to the Lewis and Clark site that's about a half mile south or a visit to Alton, Grafton or Edwardsville (which are all worth visiting, by the way).","date":1329749297000}

There were several different wines to choose from and all were tasty, I purchased the ruby red and October blush...all very reasonably priced. They were my fave! But take your time and sample as many times as you can before you decide! They allow additional sampling free of charge. I did want them to talk more about the background of the founders and each wine which wasn't done until I asked a lot of questions but the questions were answered thoroughly and without hesitation. Even found out the owner was a older black male. So I supported a black owned business without even knowing lol. \n\nWe lucked up and were able to get a picnic table and a nice socially distant grassy area for our blanket.

We have also  been pre-approved through the Costco car buying program for this vehicle, in which Costco stated Lithia was their authorized representative dealership for the Boise zip code. Costco also sent the pre-authorization email to the salesman which again clearly stated our intended vehicle purchase.  We called the salesman and inquired about test driving a truck.  He said he didn't have the exact model, but a fellow employee had one that we could view to see the trim package that we desired.   \n\nUpon our arrival,  everything went great.   Everyone was attentive to our requests.   Everyone knew exactly what we were looking for.   We were glad we had communicated in advance so there was no question as to which truck we were after.

Went inside, sat down and began the ordereing process. \n\nOnce the order was complete, printed out and ready to go,  it was at this point we were told that they didn't honor the Costco price for this truck.

The beef vermicelli used to be a terrific flank steak that had a nice smokey flavor, now it tastes like eye round that is pan seared.

We had waited such a long time (almost an hour which is ridiculous for Vietnamese food) we just told the staff to forget the replacement. No real apology or even acknowledgment of it happening. After that they never filled our water again until everyone was completely out and we had to ask. Ten years ago the waiters would talk to you and the place was a real treat. We went there once or twice a month. About five years ago it sold and the waitstaff completely changed but the food was still just as good.

Our dinner was billed as being Yugoslavian recipes, and I was impressed with the spices and depth of flavors. I've never had Yugoslavian versions of paprikash or goulash, these at Taste of Europe were much better than the other dishes I'd tried.

So, during this time, I was roaming around the showroom and had brief encounters with other folks working there. They too were very pleasant. \n\nAs to price, it was explained to me that they have some sort of \"price-sweeper\", which trolls the internet looking for lower prices than theirs. So, if a lower price is found at a competitor, that is the price you pay. Knowing this stopped me from running all over town shopping for price, which can be time-consuming and aggravating.\n\nI did not use the shooting range. There was a long queue of people waiting.

Seemed like the right incentive  to get me over there.  Order at the counter and your meal is brought to you. Outdoor seating is available and it is BYOB.\n \n \nThe traditional ground chuck Miles Burger comes on a brioche with applewood bacon, remoulade, cheddar, lettuce, and tomato with fries on the side for $12.50. The real disappointing catch with the half off deal is that all of the super fun adds on are NOT included. Add ins like bacon, mushrooms, avocado, fried egg and another $1.50 and mushroom, caramelized onion, and roasted pepper are $1 each.  So once you add things to make it more than just a plain burger, the savings greatly decrease. But the burger patty was big and cooked almost to the medium rare requested. Fries were good; thin and crispy, with standard ketchup to dip them in.\n\n \nI had the falafel burger, which comes with tahini, lettuce, tomato, and feta, regularly $9.50. Again the feta was not included in the half off, but I felt it was necessary to have it on top.  I liked the crispy outside, mushy inside  texture and chickpea flavor. As far as non-meat burgers go, I think I prefer a more carrot plus greens taste, but this has a certain appeal\n \nIt does appear to be Wednesday, the deal is all day, and while it might not be the super bargain I was hoping for, you can save a few dollars.

Not being able to sit due to the pain I printed off the paperwork and filled it out as instructed prior to my appointment (which turned out to be completely redundant) when I arrived at my appointment time I had to fill out more paper work when the nurse finally called me back to take my height and weight she wrote it down on a napkin she took from her pocket then took me into an exam room where she proceeded again have me fill out the new patient forms. By 4:00 she was finally done and I was in excruciating pain and she told me she would have the doctor in shortly I waited alone in the exam room for 45 minutes before the doctor came in he apologized and explained that he had just been with another patient who came in with a sore throat but they began talking and an hour later he diagnosed him with depression (I'm sure he was not supposed to disclose this information to me) he asked me to describe the pain scale of one to ten I told him around an 8 & explained that it kept getting worse I explained my sister was prone to abscesses here that I hadn't fallen recently etc etc within 10 minutes of speaking to me (not touching or examining me) he told me my tail bone was irritated and prescribed me a high dose of ibuprofen. At the end of the appointment he felt my hips and when I directed him to where the pain was he didn't even look or touch there he assured me that it was an irritated tail bone and prescribed me a low dose pain killer as well. He spent a total of 15 minutes with me and told me he wanted me to have an X-ray done next week. By the time I got home I was dying the pain had only progressively gotten worse when my older sister came home that evening (who is a vet) she took one look at my tail bone and told me my doctor was an idiot because I clearly have a visible abscess about the size of a golf ball. I toughed out the pain over the weekend to save money and not go to the emergency room only to call the office Monday morning to explain that I clearly had an abscess and was misdiagnosed I was then informed that I had been ordered an X-ray and the doctors would not see me until I had the X-ray performed. At this point I was so livid I hung up on the receptionist (which I am sorry for as it was not their fault for their doctors incompetence) and went to the emergency walk in clinic where I was seen in 10 minutes and as soon as the doctor actually examined me he said without even touching he could see I had an abscess the size of a softball on my tail bone that had it been caught on Friday could have been healed with antibiotics.

It seemed that there was only one girl working that night (slow Tuesday) plus the kitchen staff. She was very nice, attentive and explained both menus very well. They offer their regular menu and a 5-corse chef tasting menu for $65 with an optional wine pairing for $45. Their menu offers great variety and very unique dishes. We ordered the butchers plate and the steamed pork buns to start--neither disappointed in flavor, though I was surprised at the lack of pork in the buns. The boyfriend and I split the yellowfin tuna and the carbonara--these were both fantastic! The carbonara was rich and creamy with a perfect addition of bacon, spinach & topped with a poached egg.

I am a huge fan of FroYo and I have been to other locations and really enjoy the thrill of getting to build my own dish with wacky flavors. A few weeks ago, I attempted to go to this location around 8:30. I checked their hours online before going and saw that they closed at 10:00, so I assumed there would be no issue. However, when I rolled up to the store, I noticed that the hours sign had been taken down and the doors were locked. Now I understand that this happens occasionally, perhaps an emergency or broken equipment necessitated an early close. I still thought it was strange that there was no sign advising customers of the sudden change in hours of operations. The employees looked at me as I pulled the door, but did not approach me, so I left... very disappointed. \n\nI got a craving for FroYo again tonight, and I went again around 8:40. Much to my surprise, the exact same situation happened! When I pulled on the door, an employee approached the door and explained to me that \"all the machines were broken\" and that they had decided to (yet again) close early. While I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt last time, I am not going to be fooled twice again. This place has lost my business, and I will be sure to not waste my time trying again in the future.","date":1516590214000}

I took photos, but since my cell had no service.. they didn't save. Weird how that's been happening. Anywho... we were extremely excited to check out this theater for the last few months because of the close proximity to our house as well as the luxury seats. However, we were quickly disappointed. \n\nThe theater had popcorn ALL over the seats and the floor. It wasn't even cleaned before our movie. We know because we showed up 30 minutes early and sat in the theater to hangout. \n\nAnother issue, the power went out for about a minute and reset everything. All the screens were down & we lost money playing the arcade games. They looked us dead in the eye and ignored the fact they knew we put money in for a game that shut off. Lastly, going back to the cleanliness, the employees do a poor job of keeping up on the theater. If you look at the seats (totally unintentionally noticed), the grease from each previous head was still remaining on the headrest. SO gross. Definitely need to disinfect and wipe down. There was a visible white spot where heads rest... on MANY seats, not just one. \n\nThe theater & screen is smaller than I'm used to but still nice. The ambiance is neat. The popcorn was fresh and not stale like more theaters... same with the candy. \n\nOverall, the theater has potential to be a five star. I realize they may not have had control over the power going out for a minute; however, they completely have control over the cleanliness of a \"luxury\" theater. For now, this is a 3-star experience, at best.","date":1582604639000}

I live in WA and I called on a truck I found using cars.com.  The salesman was confused on the vehicle in question.  I can give a free pass on that as I am sure there are hundreds of vehicles on the lot.  He called me back about an hour later after he found the truck I was looking at and we talked about my trade in, which is a 2014 Dodge truck with every option.  I texted pictures, VIN #, and info after which I was subjected to a lowball offer (~$10k under blue book) and told that the price on the truck at the dealership was non negotiable (which is fine with me as their sale price was good).  The trade in offer was as bad as I have experienced in this recent truck search and nearly 4000 less than a recent offer at a local dealership.  The salesman went on to tell me that \"the dealership right across the street has your exact truck brand new for 49000.\"  I told him there was no way that was possible, based on my recent purchase of a nearly identical vehicle. A quick Google search proved that there was no dealership across the street and the dealership to which he was probably referring to had the truck listed for $63775.  It turns out prices on that model didn't drop by 15000 dollars in 7 months.  What a surprise.  I enjoy being lied to almost as much as I enjoy being treated as if I am incapable of researching anything or making an informed decision.   It's astonishing that a dealership can operate like this and somehow remain in business.  There are quite a few 1 star reviews, apparently for good reason....","date":1427940079000}

The three eggs, hash browns, cheddar cheese, and pork roll on a long seeded roll are a perfect antidote for a night of partying.

The director Ruwini was also wonderfully accommodating and flexible in working with our changing schedules. \n\nI originally heard about STLP through a friend who found a groupon to try it out. It was close to us so we gave it a shot, and from day one we were impressed with the calm atmosphere and how quickly our daughter took to the teachers and routine.  We recently switched our daughter from STLP to the UCSB center because a full-time spot opened up for her there.

The wonderful smell of the place, the cleanliness, friendliness, and tastiness are all five-star.  Only the somewhat high prices bring it down 1\/2 star.  I'm always reminded of that YouTube video about gettin' real in  the Whole Food Parking Lot, where the guys parks his Prius, shops for organic kale and quinoa, and must  \"pay my 80 bucks for 6 things and get the heck out.\"\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2UFc1pr2yUU&feature=plcp\n\nSo yeah, it's a bit overpriced, but you mostly get what you pay for. Their deli foods are outstanding, decent cheese selection, nice fresh breads (actually priced below average), and top notch meats.  I've been buying whole bean coffee recently, and at $11\/pound it's a bit high, but the taste is worth it. I've found some of the same coffee at online mail-order for $35\/lb. And in general, their bulk foods (nuts, candy, snacks, etc) are outstanding, but pricey.  The good part is, you can buy as much or as little as needed.\n\nGroceries are interesting, with lots of unusual high-end products.  I stocked up when they had Rao's spaghetti sauce WAY below supermarket prices.  But I've found herbs and spices much cheaper elsewhere. They have some amazing chocolates, but you will pay for the privilege of enjoying these stunning intoxicants. Again, their deli and pre-made foods are mostly fantastic: their spare ribs (2 ways) at $10\/lb are mouth-watering, ready-to-cook pizzas are yummy, and many of the salads are really, really good. But $8 for a small piece of pre-cooked salmon does not tempt me.  Their sushi, however, is quite fresh and reasonably priced. \n\nBottom line: if you know what things cost elsewhere, you can shop intelligently. There are some excellent products here, cheaper than Publix, and some fairly expensive things that are absolutely worth your money, if you love great foods. (I draw the line at $11\/lb for lemon-yogurt covered almonds).  And overall, the shopping experience at Fresh Market is very very pleasant, free coffee samples and all. (No discounts for Prius drivers.)\n\nOverall rating: 4.5 stars","date":1342544480000}

However, Time management is a major issue!  I arrived 5 minutes early only to wait until 15 minutes AFTER my slotted time to even start.  They give you a beverage while you wait, but so what that's kind of standard now.   So late start- exasterbated by stylist with a very low tempo.  No sense of urgency or concentration as she would randomly call out to coworkers passing by-  Hi!\/You look cute today\/How are you.  It's one thing to be friendly but another to seem totally distracted.  She didn't use a brush to blow out my long, think curly hair.  she just pulled it and manipulated it with her hands.  This seemed odd.  It took forever. She also clocked me in the head with the hair dryer twice.  Didn't acknowledge it the first time, the second she laughed and said-\"i'm not mad at you.\"    After blow dry she plugged in the straightening iron (!!! why wasn't it on already?) One hour and 15 minutes after my appointment time i let her know that I need to be somewhere-  in an effort to get her to speed up as my hair was not even close to straight.   Blown Away is superior in their counterspace. My stylist seemed confused where to put things or make room for the tools.  Breeze is superior in the end result-  it just takes a LONG time to get it.   Thankfully,  she called over Josh (the manager or lead stylist??) and asked for help.  Both of them began straightening my hair-  and he gave her tips on doing a better blow out (namely- using a brush) next time.  This is a huge advantage over Blown Away- they do not have a \"Josh\" but rather a well dressed girl who walks by and blankly says \"prettttty\" and \"cuuuuuute.\"  One hour and forty minutes later i walked out with a great sleek blow out.   it lasted 3 days and i would return -only i will ask not to have the same stylist.  a work in progess but regardless a great service for people like me with thick curly hair.","date":1355167516000}

This is an improvement already.  My server was equally quick to check in with me and take my order.  \n\nI asked for an omelet that was not specifically listed on the menu and they happily accommodated me.  I am accustomed to the Darlings egg cake folded over the contents with absolutely no cohesion except for the half melted cheese.

I was also pleased that my toast was served dry with real butter on the side, which is the way I like it since I can't stand the butter blend that so many places use and then call butter.\n\nOne more thing to mention in the contrast between these two places but I noticed that across the board  Mugshot was at least $1 less on each thing that I compared.\n\nBottom line, Mugshot is what I wish Darlings was and I would totally go there often if they were a tad more conveniently located.  Oh well.  I can still say good things about them.","date":1372017788000}

Going in I wasn't sure whether to expect a high-end diner like Darling's, or your run-of-the-mill trashy diner with decent food. Turns out it's a botched attempt at both. The place seems like it was quickly thrown together by a bunch of boneheads. The decor is dumb and cliche. The food is incredibly bland and overpriced. The menu is essentially your typical overlong diner menu, and that's OK, if the food satisfies that classic diner craving. But it doesn't really. My quesadilla was dry and on a crap tortilla. It was accompanied by two unappetizing plastic to-go cups of generic salsa and sour cream. Clearly no thought went into any of this. \n\nAfter having browsed the menu and then eaten, it feels a little bit like the owners are trying to pull the wool over your eyes. \"This Fishtown crowd loves eating-out and paying top dollar!\" was likely the consensus. Unfortunately, people aren't so stupid. It's a shame because a solid diner is actually something lacking in the neighborhood.\n\nWhile I always see people in the restaurant, there is the unmistakeable sense of failing-restaurant-dread hanging over the place. An odd sense of desperation seems to be shared among the entire staff. Our waitress even wrote \"Please come again!\" on both sides of our check, which is very nice but a little sad given the context. The folks at the register asked us twice whether the service was good. And when I said \"Yes\" they seemed wary of believing me. It's true though - the service is decent. The food is not.

My 4-year-old dog, which has treated at Battleground since she was a puppy, recently saw Dr. Bob for her shots, and for renewal of her Sentinel Rx, which she has taken since she was a puppy.   During the visit, I twice asked Dr. Bob about the Sentinel, and was led to believe everything was in order for the re-fill, which I had planned to purchase online.  He made no mention that she would need a blood test or that I would have to sign a waiver as he had previously allowed me to do.  The only thing he said was for me to tell the receptionist where I would be purchasing the Sentinel, which I did.  When I tried to purchase the Rx online, Battleground denied it.  I immediately contacted Battleground about the matter and was told I would need to take my dog in for a blood test.   I advised the girl I spoke with that I had just been there less than a week ago, and Dr. Bob made no mention of a blood test or signing of a waiver.  I was told I would be called back---that never happened so, after several days went by without a return phone call, I called and left a message for Dr. Bob to call me.  Well guess what, folks-----no return phone call!   I next wrote him a letter detailing the events as they happened----again, no response.   As a last resort, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, which they forwarded to him.  You guessed it------no response.

They have several types to choose from on a daily basis and then they offer either one or two special breads of the day.  My favorites?

I seldom get the treats, so I cannot comment too extensively on that--but I did get their chocolate chip cookie mix a few times and good lord are those some fabulous cookies!  Oh!  And, they offer a sample slice of bread to every customer--take it!  More often than not, it is still warm from the oven and they serve real butter with it!

I'm not the biggest fan of fusion, but dumplings are kind of an even playing field for most cuisines so I was hopeful.

The consensus of all of them is that they don't really have enough flavor to be a dumpling, nor the food that they're paying homage to. The buffalo chicken was my favorite, but only after adding the house hot sauce. The honey chipotle chicken was completely unnoteworthy, the cheesesteak needed salt and cheese, and the other two were just okay.

I also asked that my rice and veggies not be packed until my food was ready as I try to cut down on the broccoli steam stink as much as possible and because no matter how hard you will the heat lamps, the food gets cold.

These requests being the aforementioned packaging all of it at once and cooking to order items on the menu that were not available.\n\nI couldn't tell if it was incompetence or just a terrible attitude but I'm leaning towards the latter because I was the only customer, ordered two bowls, and there was about 6 staff. \n\nThe same annoyed and now attitude filled employee with blonde hair whose name begins with T really went off the handle when I asked for a refund (at this point, who wouldn't?).

Sure, there was a long line, but I consider that standard for Ross. Sure, some shelves had low stock, though that's a common issue during the holidays, which is only exacerbated by this year's Covid-induced supply chain problems. My only expectation was to find some gift-worthy goodies, and that expectation was met. \n\nI picked up a jug of moonshine-inspired hot sauce for under $10, a fun gag gift for $5.99, a large jar of mixed peppercorns for $3.99, and another present--won't name it because the recipient might read this!--for under a fiver. The candle selection was mostly picked clean so I didn't choose one, but there were still some left. Plenty of clothing and home goods too. \n\nThe store was also quite organized. Pictures indicate that sometimes things get out of hand, however both times I've visited this location it has been pretty well kept. Check-out was smooth, with a very friendly employee, and I left in under 30 minutes. Pretty good for holiday shopping on December 22nd.","date":1640278477000}

It began on Nov. 21, when I though a Walmart Plus battery that I had bought in May 2020 had gone dead in six months.  What contributed to that was the fact that the battery has 12 one-star online reviews where customers reported similar.\n\nAs it turned out, after getting no satisfactory resolution from Walmart, I brought the car and battery to a VERY reliable local auto repair shop, one that practices SAFE DISTANCING measures and (luckily for me) learned it was not the battery.\n\nHowever that doesn't change the fact that in thirty days, I never got a resolution from Walmart to, what their customer service repeatedly promised in their email responses, my satisfaction.\n\nAll I wanted from them was that I be allowed to bring the battery for checking, via the same safe distancing measures followed when I ordered then picked it up curbside, in May, and if found to be faulty, having the battery's warranty fulfilled.  In that, I was met with failure on every level:\n\nThe online chat, in which I was told that I only had 90 days to replace the item (despite its 2 year warranty) and that she couldn't help me via chat. \n\nThe four attempted calls to Walmart customer service in which after a veritable maze of automated options, I was connected to a rate your service prompt instead of a real live customer service agent.\n\nThe emails to Walmart customer care (seven in all)  and their responses that, though courteous and promising my satisfaction, spoke of my concerns being forwarded to someone else.\n \nThen there were the repeated attempted contacts with Walmart in Chalmette. 10 calls that rang and rang with no pickup, one where someone picked up only to have a store employee say she didn't know the manager's name and that I'd have to go into the store, and a last, 20 minute long attempt, in which the employee placed me on hold when I asked for Chris (a manager) and no one came to the phone. Twelve calls to the store in all.\n\nRegarding Chris. He did call me from another number, twice, and left messages.  But I tried to call him back, twelve times in all, and even left messages. The calls were never answered. Calls he claimed (in his second message) didn't get.\n\nAs it turned out on this occasion, it wasn't the product. It was the lack of service.  In this, Walmart's failure to address this issue to my satisfaction, and in a timely manner, has convinced me to be wary of any future purchases.","date":1608668050000}

It's perfect for a late night snack if you live close enough for it's delivery service, or even if you wanna go pick it up.  \n\nMy first experience with them was great, my friends picked them up for me and when they got back we had a small pizza box full of warm, fresh, and delicious M&M, white chocolate macadamia, s'mores, chocolate peanut butter, and double chocolate cookies to share.  My friends did mention, however, how rude their employees were but I didn't think anything of it. Maybe it was just because it was past midnight and they were tired and had a long day.  No biggy.\n\nI went there by myself for the first time today, in the middle of a beautiful sunny day.  I walked into the place, I was the only person there, to find the girl working sitting on the side counter busy on her laptop.  I said \"Hi!\" and didn't get a response, just an unfriendly glare.  I ignored it and continued to look at the menu.  I approached and made my requests and she said nothing and went to grab my order.  She rang me up, without saying a word as to what the total was - just pointing to the total on the cash register.  I gave her the money and said \"Thank you\" and all I got was another rude glare as she slammed the cash drawer closed and plopped back on the counter and was occupied by her computer again.  Didn't get a single word out of her.\n\nThis time the cookies didn't taste fresh at all and were not warm.  Maybe if their employees weren't busy on Facebook and were actually doing their jobs (not the worst job to have, I might add) maybe the cookies would have tasted better, and would be more consistent.  \n\nSo you've got a decent chance of getting a good cookie, but a great chance of getting shitty service at this place.","date":1269819808000}

Biggest mistake ever. \n\nWe had two items damaged in the move. First was a TV that the mover dropped, shattering the screen. Next was my dresser (not even two years old) scratched in numerous spots. There were also countless other items that one of the movers dropped on my brand new flooring, luckily not breaking or damaging anything. \"Butterfingers,\" as I like to call him, was on his phone headset having personal conversations for most of our move (at the old house and new house).

I felt like I was interrupting him if I needed to ask him a question or tell him where to put something. We had the movers go back to our old house to pick up a few items that would not fit the first go around. My husband was in his car in front of them. My husband was at the house for about 30-45 minutes before the movers showed up. I guess they stopped to get lunch. I get it.... 9-10 is a long time to not have lunch, though I do not feel like their lunch break should come out of my pocket.\n \nWe were not contacted by anybody after the move regarding the broken\/damaged items. We had to reach out to the company numerous time. We were told that a claim would be filed, though no other details were shared. We called back a week or so later to follow-up on the status, to find out that a check was being mailed to us. Again no details shared, no amount, nothing. A couple weeks later I called the office multiple times (at least three) and at different times of the day. The office manager, Susan, is conveniently never in the office to speak with an upset customer. \n\nI feel like I need to write a separate review to talk about Susan Anderson. How she is managing a company blows my mind. She is the rudest, most unprofessional person I have ever encountered. Susan NEVER returned any of my calls, instead shot me back snarky emails. Reading other reviews of this company, it seems others have had the same experience. \n\nI receive $60 for the tv they broke. Where do I purchase a replacement tv for $60? Nowhere. They also never responded to my questions about the dresser that was damaged. They continually referred me to the contract regarding minor scratches. I also asked multiple times for them to send me another copy of the contract, no response. The damages on my dresser are not minor, also my dresser is not made of participle board, which they tried to tell me. \n\nLong story short, RUN from this company. I don't care if they told you they'd pay YOU to move your stuff. Again, I've never encountered such an awful company or management. I am struggling to understand how this company is still in business. \n\nCan I give negative 5 stars? I I could, I would.","date":1447947275000}

Chic-Fil-A does not care .... they have already been paid. They don't care because they have such a following so who cares. Chic-fil-a has been my favorite since I first ate there.

After searching for a vehicle for my wife for months, I was very aware of the different dealerships around town. I was also very aware of their practices, sales pitches and everything in between. No one enjoys going to a dealership for anything in my opinion, but Lithia Ford changed my outlook on  my thoughts that all dealerships are terrible. \n\nMy inquiry was answered by Kim Luy who is one of the nicest ladies I've ever met. Kim was very personable, friendly and didn't make it feel like a car buying experience at all. She made us feel (as corny as this sounds) like family. \n\nA few days after my purchase, I had an issue with the car. One of the service Managers (Allen) was quick to help. I must say, I thought to myself \"Here we go, already something wrong.\" I thought I would be inconvenienced, the service department was going to be terrible (like most are) and they'd have my car forever. However, my experience was much more pleasant than I though. Allen assured me that would be taken care of and he did just that and without any attitude. The customer service was beyond fantastic. \n\nI will definitely be returning to Lithia Ford for future purchases. I can't thank them enough!","date":1614964907000}

At least my cousin had told me when we went together. Also we went here for lunch, so I will be focusing on the lunch details rather than dinner. \n\nWhat I really appreciated about this place is that their lunch menu is simple yet extremely sophisticated when it comes to taste. Their weekday lunch is mainly just a specific dish of the day. In my case, I had gone on a Wednesday which was the bacon-wrapped meatloaf, glazed carrots, and smashed taters (as they have it). But there is something that I must mention first and it's their spinach house salad. \n\nORGASMIC! The salad was just to die for. I've never had such a heavenly salad in my entire young and sweet lemonade life! There was something about the dressing that tickle your taste buds. It's sweet with a fruity tang that disperses right as it enters your mouth yet slowly fades - pulling your urges for more bites. The pickled vegetables were crisp to the sound and gave the spinach a very fresh taste. Usually when spinach is dampened by the dressing then it sort of dies out (you know?) but not this salad. Everything felt so alive that it gives you the feeling of enjoying a sweet meal starter fresh from your own garden. \n\nThe bacon wrapped meatloaf was extremely tender and delicious. The saltiness of the bacon complimented the more meat weighted meatloaf - giving it a homemade taste that no other restaurant could compete. Also the glazed carrots added a very nice touch to the meatloaf and the smashed taters. First, I was a bit skeptical thinking, \"Ah, this is might be a bit too sweet.\" (since I don't like sweet foods that much). However, when I was really surprised on how everything blended so well together. The smashed taters, I think, was far by the favorite (aside from the salad). It had a very creamy taste that's not sickening to the stomach but rather satisfying to our pallet. \n\nOf course, in a place like this we had to get dessert as well. It was pudding with some chocolate crumbs on top. The crumbs itself tasted a bit bitter; hence, you needed to dip into the vanilla pudding to get it together. Honestly, out of the restaurants I've gone to in St. Louis (that aren't Asian), Farmhaus knows how to blend tastes. It's always salty is salty, sweet is sweet in food, but not them - they make your taste buds explore every bit of sweetness, saltiness, and smokiness in their dishes. \n\nAlong with the delicious lunch our server was extremely generous as well. She took the time walk us through the meal (though it was simple) - explaining what was in it. Also she wasn't one of those typical tip-hungered servers where they constantly pop up from under your table or something crazy asking, \"Everything alright?!\" She actually gave us time to ourselves where we can truly enjoy our meal. \n\nI definitely would love to return to Farmhaus but on a different lunch day to try their other dishes. Also I would love to try their dinner since I was told that's when things get much better. Really? I can't imagine anything getter any better than what is already the best.","date":1350411606000}

One of the things that attracted us to Artesano was the unique menu options, and we came away from our tasting very impressed.  More importantly, our guests loved the food and couldn't stop talking about it.  We opted for a cocktail hour featuring a sushi station and passed hors d'oureves, followed by two buttered tapas and two stations for dinner.\n\nWalking into the ceremony was a magical experience as the room was lit by candlelight and felt very intimate.  After the ceremony Colleen, the day of captain, made sure her team had every detail covered.  From servers to bartenders, we were very impressed by the staff.  Colleen was particularly impressive and made all of the work seem effortless, even though it clearly was not.  \n\nThe setting speaks for itself - the collection of iron art work on the walls and throughout the space provide great ambiance leaving a limited need for other decoration and extra elements.

I usually would go to Andy Nails but, Andy Nails was busy.. But, I called jq nails at about 3:45pm making sure they could take 2 manis and pedis in; Preferring a female for the both my mom and myself.. Who I spoke to Christina; Who said \"Sure.. Could you come about 4?\" I told her that I would call them back.. After checking with Andy Nails (being they were full) I called jq nails back (about 15 minutes later) Christina answered again.. And she asked how long would I be before getting to the salon? So, I told her about 5 minutes (after leaving Andy Nails) I stopped and got gas give or take took me about 15 minutes to get there plus traffic.. So, at this point my mom decided she'll wait to get her main and pedi done another time.. So it was only going to be me.. When I got to jq nails, I walked in.. A man at his work station, working on a customer.. Not even 20 seconds into the salon, yells at me \"You're too late! You said 5 minutes!\" I was like Wow.. (Rude) Thinking how the hell did he know it was even me who called? I've never seen this gentleman.. I must have made quite a conversation.. Lol.. So, Christina walks up to me and says \"Yea, you did say 5 minutes\" But then, realizes I was alone so she asked, \"Its only you?\" Which my response and body language saying and nodding \"Yes\" So she says, \"Oh okay then.. it's okay!\" I then, realized she was the only female working there and then I recognized that she was who worked on my mom the first visit..The girl who worked on me which I then, I found out she only worked weekends.. So, after picking my polish color I was sat down right away on the pedicure chair.. In the middle of my pedicure.. Another customer walks in which I'm assuming was there for an appointment with Christina from their conversation.. I feel like my pedicure was rushed and not thorough.. And getting my manicure, the water soak didn't have any soap, solution, micro exfoliant.. Nothing. Just plain ol' good ol' water.. Each hand wasn't soak for no more than 5 minutes each.. Which I thought you soak your hands so your cuticles can soften.. I tried to make conversation by asking \"Have you been busy today?\" She replied \"Yea, (eyes wide) I'm a little behind, I have customers waiting.\" Which made me feel like I was being pushed and rushed even more and at this point I did felt bad.. So, I didn't say anything to her for the rest of the time.. Manicures and pedicure together here is a total of $40.00.. If I'm paying $40.00 plus tip, I'd like to get a nice, attentive treatment.. Not being rushed.. As my nails dries under the dryer; Christina came and applied my top coat.. So then I said, \"I'm sorry for any inconvenience.. I'll make an appointment next time\" She says, \"Yea, don't just say you'll come (in 5 minutes) and not come on time\" My reaction was speechless! I've had a Manicure license years ago and this was just a reminder of why I don't work in a nail salon anymore. I understand you are trying to run a business but, a better (way of) communication would be efficient. I don't understand why their way of talking can be so obnoxious at times.. But, the look of the salon is very clean, very beautiful lighting chandelier.. The owner was very nice to customers, very helpful, very active and attentive at his own salon.. Which is why we made the drive to this salon deeper into Avon, expected better treatment (all around) for the area.. So my recommendation would be; Go earlier, like in the early morning when their not so busy.. For just a walk in after 3pm, make an appointment! I'll just stick to my convenient locations more towards Rockville Road!","date":1523714887000}

One bedroom was unfurnished aside from two small bookshelves.  The entire move of 37 miles took just over 12 hours, being billed at an hourly rate.  Twelve hours, for a 2 bedroom apartment.  Both apartments were third floor units.\n\nThe movers arrived in a rented Uhaul truck, not the branded trucks pictured repeatedly on the website.  They proceeded to carry small to medium boxes, 1-2 at a time up and down the stairs, not using any of the equipment they had.  \n\nI witnessed them stand outside their truck and have a conversation with the apartment maintenance staff about the shoes one of the movers was wearing.  \n\nI witnessed one of the movers not be present for periods of time, and then would be walking over from the next building, the opposite direction of the truck.  The billing, again, was an hourly rate.\n\nThey tried to tell us the last large item wouldn't fit in the truck, so they couldn't take it.  When they actually were told to take it downstairs, it fit easily.\n\nAt the unload site they said their boss didn't realize it was a third floor move, so they weren't prepared, and what is why it was taking so long.  A communication from and to their company beforehand indicates third floor.\n\nAt the \"completion\" of the unload, the movers departed with the following not completed:  Dining room table not reassembled, multiple pieces of furniture still wrapped in moving blankets, feet were not reinstalled on couch.\n\nWe had provided a dozen bottles of cold water for them at each location, and found them thrown on the ground in the stairwell outside the new apartment.\n\nI attempted to contact Big Boys during the move to express my concerns, but only received recorded messages about how busy they were.  I emailed them on the moving day, with no response.  On moving day +5, I contacted them via phone, was was informed they only correspond via email.  That day I did recieve an email stating they had \"requested copies of all documentation so that I can respond to all the matters brought to my attention.\"\n\nI emailed asking for a follow up 7 days later, on moving day +12.  No response.\n\nI called asking for a follow up the next day on moving day +13, with no response.  I called once more and did have the opportunity to discuss the problems with a company representative.\n\nShe was dismissive from the beginning repeatedly referring to the \"black and white\" of the contract.  I asked if she was willing to give me any accommodation for the problems, which she was not.\n\nI explained I would be forced to relay the facts of my move wherever possible.  She responded by informing me she \"has Google too\" and can write what she wants.  I asked her if she was threatening me, and she said it was her \"Constitutional right\" to say what her opinion of me was online.\n\nPlease consider this experience when choosing a mover.  I have moved 3 times in the last 7 years, and this is the longest experience by time.  It is also easily the most expensive.","date":1542409445000}

The buying experience was awesome and the salesman was amazing. Everything was smooth until about 3 days after we purchased the truck. That's when our nightmare began, and our new truck left us stranded and we had to get it towed. They told us that they fixed the issues, and we should be good to go but we experienced it stalling again. We had it towed to the dealership and they replaced the battery. The truck was running ok for a little bit, than it stalled on us 2 minutes after leaving our home, which thankfully we were able to get it back to the house and had it towed in the morning. They said they replaced the throttle body on the truck, but once it died on us again my boyfriend looked up the part number on the invoice and it turned out they replaced a sensor not the throttle body. So, we took the vehicle home because we put our faith into the dealership. Saturday we attempted to take the truck and it died yet again! We were able to start the truck about 20 minutes later and make it to the dealership. They have now had the truck for 3 days and they provided us with a rental. We received a call yesterday and they said there is nothing wrong with the truck and we had to return the rental and pick up our truck. My boyfriend than refused and said something is clearly wrong with the truck because it stalled 2 more Times. At this point, we are pretty upset because we just made our first truck payment, and all of these issues have not been resolved. It has not only been exhausting, but a huge inconvenience. We are hoping to get this resolved so we can actually enjoy our new truck!","date":1530650069000}

Lets see, first I pulled into a bay and it took my first two quarters. The mechanism was bad and would take a couple quarters and then get stuck. Move over to another bay (2nd bay of this trip), put it the first 2.50 and put the engine cleaner on - the time ran out before I could even rinse it off. Put in another 2.50 - got the truck wet and yep the time ran out. Decided to run my credit card since it was obvious this was going to be an expensive ordeal - it couldn't communicate so back over to the change machine again to get yet more quarters. Got the car soaked up and now the bay says it was down so I decide to just go through the automated car wash bay. Before I could pull out of the bay a guy came up to me and asked if he could use that bay because his bay stopped working and he had soap all over his MB - I moved to allow him to rinse and it wouldn't work for him either. I decide to give the automated bay a try (my third bay), two attempts at using a CC to pay for the $8 silver wash with the same communication error. So I paid cash, asked for a receipt and no paper in the machine. Pulled up and watched as it went through one cycle of slight mist for a pre wash and then a heavy cycle for a pre wash and then waited for the soap - nope it told me that I could pull through my time was done, The silver wash comes with a dry cycle but as I'm sure you've already guessed by now that didn't happen either. I pull back into bay #4 of the day just to rinse off the truck again to make sure no suds were left on it. The guy in the MB tried to use the auto bay as well and it wouldn't work (Im assuming he was out of cash and needed to use his card) so he left without getting his car rinsed at all. Another lady was voicing her displeasure with how expensive it was, she had spent almost $15 to wash and vacuum her Subaru Forrester. I swear Im not making this up, another man gets out of his car from trying to use the auto bay and says it took his $7 for a bronze wash and never even wet his car. I paid over $15 and still haven't gotten the truck washed completely.","date":1461109570000}

Do not buy from this company! The only reason I purchased from this company instead of Salter Spiral Stairs was because they claimed to have an installer in my area. I ordered the stairs on Nov 18th, and it is printed in big letters on the receipt that the stairs will be shipped in 3 weeks. After 6 weeks and no contact from the company, my contractor called the sales rep, and about 5 other people, to find out that there was a fire in their factory, which set back all their deliveries. Why didn't they contact me and let me know? Why was it so hard to find out what happened? I don't know, but I was finally sent a tracking # from my sales rep for the delivery, it only said that the stairs would be delivered in 3 pieces weighing 574 lbs. The stairs arrived in 3 big boxes on January 7th. I called the installer they recommended and he couldn't come right away, due to his schedule and the rain. When he did arrive on January 17th, he said he couldn't do anything because they did not ship the center pole. This man and his assistant had driven 2 1\/2 hours to get to my home in San Diego. Now they had to drive back, their entire day was wasted. The installer told me that The Iron Shop should pay me back for their extra day of time, since it was their mistake. I agreed, and I emailed my sales rep who told me it was my fault for signing for the delivery, and we waited too long anyway! The stairs still haven't been installed (planned for next week) so I can't even comment on the quality, but if it's anything like their customer service, they will probably be crap.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: After posting the above review I was immediately contacted by two people from the Iron Shop. They were very interested in making things right. They did pay for the installers extra day of work, and apologized for the confusion.

Previously, I've had the French dip, which comes on a fresh Ciabatta with some good roast beef.","date":1340223544000}

The store has many many empty shelves and pegs. I gave up and asked the cashier about the ear buds. I was told they were probably on one of the 18 to 20 skidds of merchandise that were still in the back room. This person went on to share that the people working in the back were lazy and didn't like doing stock. Also went on to say that they have had a bunch of people recently quit, that the store manager didn't want to hire anyone over the age of 25 and they had a shoe string staff.

All that went fairly well, he did not ask us to have a lot of the details ready, so we had to get back to him on that.. But that part was relatively painless and straight forward.  \n\nNow, the starting date.. We waited quite some time, almost 2 months, I believe, for them to start. Which for the most part again, wasn't too bad.. But we were starting to see one of the main issues we had with them. YOU CAN NOT GET A HOLD OF ANYONE THAT KNOWS ANYTHING. \n\nSo we finally get a start date and they begin. That was US calling THEM. Only one secretary is all you can talk to and she seemed put off by you calling.. every time...\n\nThey siding installers were subcontracted. I sooooo wish we could have known about these two guys to begin with and just dealt directly with them. They were messy, VERY messy, but extremely fast and VERY Good. I would recommend their work to anyone. They were great. When I spoke with them, they were very accommodating. Inside while they were working, was highly unpleasant, but that's just how it goes. But these guys have very minimal contact with Dalco. They were just \"doing their job\". They didn't know about our bill or anything business related. \n\nI had a small question about a detail. Called Dalco.. Left a message.. NOTHING.. We got it figured out onsite.. I called them several more times about several other details AGAIN NOTHING. I COULD NOT GET ANYONE TO RESPOND OR CALL BACK!?!? This was a cash deal too, they were getting paid ASAP, not a drawn out payment by us at all. A person would think they would have the decency to call back. WRONG. \n\nThe gutter company came after the siding was done. Subcontracted too! They weren't here more than 20 mins if that. That is not a joke. They did good work, and were fast, but man.. OUT. \n\nSo, I had some concerns about a few things, I tried calling.. and calling...and calling.. and calling... This is not an exaggeration. I FINALLY got the guy who was responsible. All we were trying to do was get some information and PAY THEM!!!! It was ridiculous. We had a \"nice chat\". \n\nI NEVER had a contact person for the job (after the initial salesman came). I couldn't get anyone to call me back during the job. EVER. \n\nThe only time I got the \"guy\" was AFTER everything was done. 100% done. \n\nThey did not alleviate our stress level and\/or concerns. I've had better customer service buying a burger, and that's a fact. It was very very sad.. \n\nTo wrap up, good sales.. Amazing but messy installation, horrible customer service and contact. If you like giving thousands of dollars to people that will not talk to you.. have at it.. \n\nJust a side note, I had interviews with two other siding places.. They all seem like they have issues.

The funny thing is- if haircuts were less expensive, I would get more of them, thus spending more overall, but taking a big chunk at once makes me hold out for once, maybe twice a year cuts. \n\nSpecial Note: They use B&B products, which I love.","date":1357659284000}

My stylist didn't help me until 1:15. They took the walk ins who were waiting before us. We ran out of time and I had to leave with half dry hair sprayed hair and half wet hair in a bun. Upon time to pay I find out that they used the more expensive deep conditioner on us then the lesser one that I asked for over the phone so I had to pay more than was originally told. I didn't want to cause conflict on her birthday and stayed polite while trying to remind them of the time.

The building is easy to find - it's the one on the block with one of those funky cool and beautiful mosaic fronts.\n\nWe were greeted nicely by the young man behind the counter, who told us which dumplings were most popular - cheesesteak, asian pork, buffalo chicken and the gobbler turkey & stuffing dumpling. We ordered a variety - basically everything but the turkey one as we are currently turkey-d out.  We sat and admired the very funky (and a little creepy at times) art in the dining area.\n\nThe young man brought our dumplings out, piping hot, a few minutes later.  We are glad he wrote which was which on the paper linings because, well, they all look exactly the same on the outside.  The only other clue was the sauces provided - ketchup for the cheeseteak, buffalo sauce for the chicken and soy sauce for the asian pork. I have no idea what people do if they order a variety mixed together.  That would be challenging.\n\nEverything was delicious, truly, the cheesesteak bites were delightful, the asian pork probably the most like any other dumpling you'd get and the buffalo chicken zingy and savory.  \n\nI worry about this place, though.  They're making the jump from food truck- where the menu of dumplings and salads are perfect - to a restaurant. It's a tough jump, and I think in this case because the menu is so limited - just dumplings and salads - it feels like all you're eating are appetizers and sides.  Yes, 5 golf ball sized dumplings are a lot of food, equal to a meal, but it feels like you're snacking.  \n\nI would LOVE to see them succeed because I think what they're doing is clever, cool and beyond all delicious.  What it may take is expanding their restaurant menu to offer things that people associate more with a 'meal' and less with a 'snack'.  \n\nAlso, make sure the workers in local businesses around you know your product and can recommend it.  Offer them a free dumpling or something, because when their customers ask \"where's a good place to grab a bite around here?\" in a sea of chains and restaurants, you want them to say - aw, man, go to Humpty's, they have really great food and it's cool tool.

We looked all over town, got recommendations from people and the final push was a Living Social deal which was perfect - we thought that this would give us a chance to try this place out without having to commit to a large block of time.\n      It was fathers day weekend and my wife wanted to do something nice for me because it was my first Fathers day so we were very specifically told to show up early so that we could fill out paperwork.\n      So we showed up extra early to try and be respectful of the organization to an empty office.   We waited and waited and lots of people came and left during that time.  I did manage to notice the calendar on the wall that had written on that day \"Living Social Kid\" - No name - and if that doesn't make you warm and fuzzy inside, nothing will...\n     We waited in the owners office for almost an hour until we found out that she wasn't going to show up at all.  She never called us to explain the situation, she texted one of the staff to have her tell us she wasn't showing up.  No apology - No explanation.  I'm so happy that we showed up extra early out of respect for this organization.\n\nDuring the 90 minutes or so waiting for the owner, I wandered the halls and I noticed that the owner proudly has her Engineering degree framed on the wall...... why?  You're an Engineer - where I agree that's impressive - how does it qualify you for childcare or even managing a childcare facility?  Engineering might be the absolute furthest thing from caring for a baby.\n  I have a degree in Audio Engineering, does it qualify me to be a farmer?\n\n       Now as new parents, we were both VERY nervous about leaving our baby with anyone for the first time - even family - let alone a crew of strangers.  There was nobody there to tell us what was going on, who works there, what their policies are, to introduce us to the people that work there.  We just left our baby in a room of other kids and had to go because we had other appointments.\n      We were hoping to be debriefed by the owner later that day when we picked up our baby but mid-day my wife got a text that the owner was leaving early., she wouldn't be meeting us again, and again no explanation.\n\n        Don't show up for an appointment in the morning, leave early in the afternoon..... \n     Honestly, this place gets one star (or zero....) if the people that were there actually caring for our child weren't super nice and they didn't come with recommendations from multiple friends of ours.  \n\nI was seriously debating leaving my kid there at all - I had no reason to.  \n\nMind you this was the first visit our son had to this place, recently my wife left our son at this facility again for an afternoon.   \n    When my wife picked him up they told her that he smacked his face on the desk because as they were trying to feed him, they didn't belt him in.  So he just fell forward and slammed his face on the desk.... because he is a baby and LACKS THE ABILITY to hold himself up indefinitely..... hence the strap on those chairs so the kid doesn't hurt themselves.  This is pretty basic stuff here, people.\n     In order to make things easy for the staff my wife packed him a breakfast and lunch (which she labeled) of which they did not feed him at first. For breakfast, they reached into our son's diaper bag and pulled out one of my wife's Fiber One bars that is filled with lots of terrible things for him (sugar, corn syrup etc), including chocolate- WHICH HE HAS NEVER HAD.   If you look at nearly any list of things you are not supposed to give a baby, chocolate is right up there. They broke it into pieces and put it on the table for him. He could not, at that time, feed himself, so luckily he didn't eat any of the bar. They assumed he was being ornery and cleared the table, but did not offer any other food. So he had no breakfast      \n\nWe weren't even aware whether or not he has a chocolate allergy\/sensitivity because again, he had never had it.\n      I would have assumed that all of this is really basic baby knowledge - apparently not.\n\n    I wasn't comfortable leaving my kid with these people after the first visit, now I would rather leave them with the firefighters over at Station 11 next door. \n     I guarantee you he would have a better chance of survival.\n\n   If i ever leave my kid at this facility again, there is going to be a lawyer present.  Period.  Our sons' last visit borders on gross negligence and is totally and in all other ways unacceptable","date":1413951157000}

Upon wondering aloud regarding bread service, Farmhouse provided us a $6 bread plate.  It was the worst $6 we have ever spent.  We were served one large piece of uneven old toast, cut four ways.  It was burnt on some parts, barely toasted on others.  It had no taste, except of staleness: it was unsalted, dry, and far too difficult to chew, as if someone threw it back in the microwave (maybe a toaster) as an afterthought.  Two huge blocks of butter were served with it, but they were frozen and un-spreadable.  We ate the bread to see whether we would get a refill.  We did not.  We were in shock that this could come out of the kitchen of a James Beard nominee.  In contrast, Brasserie's different types of complimentary toast and bread (with dishes or without) make Farmhaus' offering seem like it came out of yesterday's garbage, and at a cost.  \n\nThe nachos continued the dissappointment.  Nachos are easy to make addictively great with a few guidelines: distribute the toppings well, melt the cheese, and create depth of flavor.  The nachos here failed at all of those basic rules.  The concept has potential, but the execution was terrible.  The sweet potatoes-qua-nachos were dry, unsalted, uninteresting, and cold.  The blue cheese was packed into one corner, unmelted.  The other ingredients were barely there.  There were four or five tiny bacon lardons, and even fewer slices of jalapeno peppers.  Compared to over twenty chips, the distribution is pathetic.  Moreover, the ketchup-style sauce was fine, but too sweet given the complete absence of salt in the chips.\n\nThe crab was a touch better.  The deep frying was appropriately done (not greasy) and the crab was flavorful.  The item tasted cheesy - perhaps it was the anchovy dressing.  It reminded us of eating a well-made crab rangoon.  But crab rangoon usually never runs you $19 (as it does at Farmhaus).\n\nThe focaccia was the best appetizer.  The braised ham hocks were tender and the focaccia itself was good: appropriately crispy crust and warm within.\n\nUnfortunately, all three appetizers were served at the exact same time.  If the kitchen here wants to highlight successful dishes, they should let you enjoy them one at a time, rather than dumping them all on a table like a buffet. \n\nThe entrees were a step up.  The red grouper is a nice dish; it's fresh, and grilled well.  The only criticism is that its accompanying sauce comes out a bit too thick for this otherwise light dish.  The meatloaf is good, but not great.  The meat itself is not dry, but could benefit from a bit more moisture.  There's flavor in the dish, mainly due to the bacon wrapping, but it's not complex.  The smashed potatoes that came with the meat are fine, but they lacked creaminess.\n\nIn sum, excluding a dish or two, most of the dishes ranged from mediocre to fine.  Anywhere else, this would be a nice dinner.  But how Farmhaus is a James Beard nominee is puzzling.  The plating and presentation is not nearly as interesting as Niche or Elaia.  The flavor profiles generally lack the complexity of Sidney Street Cafe or the warm depth of Randolfi's.  Maybe all their energy is poured into the tasting menu?  Or maybe it was an off night?  I sincerely hope it's the latter.\n\nService:\nThe service is courteous and professional.  Some servers here are good at recommending dishes and noting fan-favorites, but some are not.  All of our server's recommendations generally leaned on personal preferences without much justification or explanation, yet were always the most expensive items (indicating potential up-selling).\n\nAmbiance:\nHints of a small, lively room, with some potential for coziness.  The only down note is that the room is not as nice, romantic, or polished as what you might expect at those menu prices.","date":1465787147000}

In this case it is extremely good. We just purchased our 2nd vehicle from Lithia Ford in the last 2 years. I felt compelled to write this review because our recent experience was even better than our first experience. And our first experience was outstanding! A big part of that was due to our salesperson, Cindy Mellinger. More on her in a minute.\n\nBoth of our purchases involved a trade in of our old vehicle and the purchase of a new vehicle. When I purchase a new vehicle I do A LOT of research! By the time I am ready to pull the trigger, I know the invoice price of the vehicle and every available option. I then research on several online vehicle purchase sites to find the absolute lowest price I can get. I have been known to be a car salespersons worst nightmare and will not hesitate to abruptly end negotiations and walk out of dealership never to return.\n\nDuring both of our transactions Lithia Ford offered a fair and acceptable dollar amount for our trade ins. And yes I know exactly what those vehicles are worth as well. And, we received rock bottom prices on the new vehicles with little to no haggling. I always prepare to do battle with car sales people as that is how it has always been done in the past. But at Lithia, there was no need for that. Smooth transactions from beginning to end with zero surprises. Stress free experiences both times!\n\nOur salesperson, Cindy Mellinger went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied. She was very friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. If she didn't have the answer off the top of her head she obtained the answer quickly. She was also lightning fast in responding to us whether by text, phone or e-mail. We had modifications done to the vehicle so we couldn't get the car for more than a week mostly due to our vacation plans. Cindy did not wash her hands of us after we signed papers. She made sure everything was perfect from beginning to end over about a 2 week time frame. Needless to say we will go back to Cindy should we be in the market for another Ford in the future!\n\nI'll never go to any other Ford dealership if buying a Ford. This is the way car buying should be!","date":1451875114000}

They are open Saturdays.\nI'm not sure how they treat employees, because they are all miserable. Ok, almost all. I don't remember one polite, remotely happy employee in my experience. Once, a hurried stocking person ran over my friend in front of me and didn't stop to acknowledge the accident. Yes, he literally ran into her. The baggers have zero clue. I actually laughed out loud when I got my bags home. They'll throw everything in one bag and one random item in a second bag, put your raw meat in with whatever, including produce (and in separate bags from other raw meat), and then take your cart away. They kind of just chuck stuff in wherever. I always felt like a virus or a burden, as a customer, each time I went through the line - and sort of guilty, because these employees give off a strong \"we are in slavery and we're not crazy about it; here's your stuff, you selfish freedom-having jerk\" vibe.\nI was asked if I found everything I needed today. I asked about tahini. Cashier said 'I have no idea' and that was that. Why ask me that question, if you don't give a s*** about the answer and have no intention of helping me? No, they didn't have tahini.\nThe layout is awkward and tight. The produce is mostly 'conventional,' not much organic.\nI moved from upstate ny, the home of Wegmans, so yeah I'm a picky grocery snob, and I'm ok with that. I'm consistently disappointed by the groceries in Florida that get rave reviews. This store is highly over rated and very expensive.\nPROs: huge bulk-ish section with snack mixes, nuts, sweets, etc.; they have a decent wine area; they have \"gourmet\" and \"unusual\" grocery items on some shelves, but not often the one thing you're looking for (see: tahini); they have a nice meat selection. All of these are on the pricey side. I avoid this market, after a few trips here.","date":1398555181000}

All four of us work in the hospitality industry and both guys at our table are professionally trained chefs.  So as you can imagine, it is hard for us to dine out and really enjoy ourselves from beginning to end.  Everything from the wine to food and service met all of our expectations.  Loved the side towels as napkins on the tables.  Everyone at my table uses those towels daily at work, so to see them as my napkin is totally normal and we loved the concept of the whole place. The power even went out about 30 minutes into our meal and I was suprised that not one single person became upset or decided to leave.  The GM came out to the dining room and said, \"This isn't the first time and it won't be the last time, but we have a gas kitchen and if you all want to stay then we are prepared to continue service.\"  As he did this he brought lantern type lights and candles to several of the tables.  We just used our Iphone light app and placed it over a clean wine glass which actually gave it a nice romantic feel.  As the storm rolled in over St. Louis, we continued our meal and even another table walked in and decided to give it a try...in the dark.  Stellar if this sort of service continues.  I mean no one missed a beat during this service...WOW!  I think we ordered around 15 plates total, 3 bottles of wine and some vodka tonics.  So all in all we had a great time and would DEFINITELY go back...and soon.  My two favorite dishes were the snapper fish special last night with the fire grill taste and cooked to perfection and the peanut butter jelly dessert...OMG heaven.  We were probably the loudest table as we could not help but have a great time last night.  Couldn't have caught up with some friends from out of town under better circumstances.  Even with the power going out and not being able to get our check at the end (I mean they trusted everyone in the place to leave their names and numbers down so they could call us with the balance the following day) it was by far the best dinner I have had in STL to date.  St. Louis has alot of great food to offer, but the overall experience is lacking.  Not for Farmhaus though, they have it down pat.  THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!","date":1365692746000}

I am writing this almost 4 months after the move because I wanted to give the company several chances to correct their errors in a suitable manner......THEY DID NOT AND HAVE NOT.)   This was the second time I used them for a small move, The first time was adequate, the second time was not. A year later, it was very different and upsetting. This time the movers showed up late and worked very slowly, complaining that they had worked a 15 hour day previously.  The movers moved slowly and shrink wrapped everything, whether it needed it or not. Even as \"carefully wrapped\" as they were, they still broke a vintage mirror that belonged to my grandmother... Then, for a 10 minute overage, they charged us a FULL hour ($109) !! Even before finishing the move, they charged my debit account without authorization for the bill. It was a VERY unpleasant experience, and I have been unable to resolve my disputes after repeatedly contacting their customer service about my complaints.\nTruthfully my complaint is not with the moving crew but with the extremely unprofessional way the company deals with their customers. The movers were apologetic and called their boss to report the accident and sent photos to the office. We were repeatedly apologized to and told not to worry, the office will handle getting this replaced. Unfortunately, this story does not have a happy ending.\nAs a result, two complaints:\n1. Broken Antique Mirror   2. Over charged \n\nTrying to contact anyone at the office is a nightmare. They only handle claims  via email. So I started our email chains and we received one resolution, for the mirror. The other issue was still open . I requested multiple phone calls to speak about this situation, with a response of no, that they only deal with claims via email. After multiple attempts to get a resolution, this basically ended with them hiding behind the contract . I was also informed that since I accepted payment for the mirror repair that all complaints were closed! \nTo rub salt on an open wound, the claims rep handed us off to the office manager Susan, who then accused me of threats. It was not a threat it was a promise that if they did not do what was right , I would make my displeasure known far and wide. \n\n\"Dear David:\nI understand that you are not satisfied however, you cashed the check indicating your agreement to the resolve.  I am not permitted to refund money based on your threat of bad reviews.  Again, I am sorry that we were not able to satisfy you. \nSincerely,\nSusan Anderson\nExecutive Administrative Assistant - Office Manager\nBIG BOYS MOVING & STORAGE\nBIG trucks, BIG movers BIG savings TM\"\n\nAs a result, I would NEVER recommend, ANYONE use this company, and if you do, just pray their movers are on time and don't break anything because their \"customer service\" and claims process is an absolute nightmare, not to mention a joke.","date":1529597244000}

My husband had Szechuan Beef.  The beef was very tender, there were lots of veggies, but it was not very spicy.  I ordered the Hunan Beef.  Again the beef was very tender with lots of veggies, but not spicy.  Each dish was in a very thick soy flavored gravy.  You could have a choice of rice but I was not asked and it arrived with Fried Rice.  The rice tasted like onions with soy sauce on it.  The egg roll that came with mine was fried very crisp and was a pork egg roll.  I prefer vegetable egg rolls so not to happy with that.  All in all we will not be going back.

Salesman Jim  showed my wife and I 3 beds. All had the ability to raise the bottom of the bed. We decided on one that was being discontinued and had a lower price. We asked what we were giving up by going with this bed. We were told it \"has a slightly different feel\" which I could not detect. We understood that the bed we purchased had non independent leg raising capabilities. Bed is delivered and it is a lower end model that could not raise the bottom of the bed. Checked the sales order (that we signed) and sure enough we purchased the bed indicated on the order. Called the sales person who referred us to customer service who said we could exchange for an added cost of $1,100. Sure we are guilty of not checking the model number at the point of sale. The sales person should have reviewed it with us more clearly. Additionally I believe the sales person made a mistake which he did not own. We made this purchase given the information that was provided and it may cost us over $1,000. Both the sales person and sleep number customer service are sub standard.","date":1550589701000}

I will never go to this Taco Bell again. It's not the first time I have had crap service. I arrived at 10:00 pm, went through the drive thru....was asked to pull around to the front while they make my order, and that they would bring it out to me. They were supposed to bring out 2 orders that I was delivering to customers. I waited 30 minutes, and an employee comes out and tells me they don't have any chicken or steak only beef, so they can't make one of the orders. Meanwhile, multiple cars had gone through the drive thru and received their order but apparently it takes 30 minutes to compute that they should tell the client that they can't make the order...they couldn't have told me they were out of ingredients 5-10 minutes after they asked me to park? This was an order that was made long before all those other cars they served went through the drive thru. The client didn't want beef so they canceled the order. I patiently waited another 30 minutes for the other order. Meanwhile they brought out food for other clients waiting and the drive thru was busy. Both the orders were not very large, I might add. On average they were $6 each. After and hour of total waiting, I called the client and they canceled. I never saw anyone come out and attempt to talk to me even 30 minutes after they came out about the other order. I guess they figure if they ignore it, it will go away. It worked. I'll never go back to this Taco Bell. It;s not the first time they have been incredibly slow or out of ingredients but this was at a level of ineptitude that I have never seen in fast food. I spoke to a few other people sitting in their cars waiting on their deliveries and they told me that this restaurant usually has very long waits.

Over the years it seemed like the quality just kept going down, not just with the food but also with the up keeping of their restaurant. i would mainly go to the oddie location next to what was once Kmart which i think is their best location. These past few years i catch myself thinking to myself \"why did i buy from here again\" once i enter their doors and get home to open my food. Ive been very disappointed with them but always go back hoping things got better (which they haven't). the food isn't awful and have some highlights, and the people working have always been friendly. i just hope they can get a hold of themselves before they drive themselves into going out of business.  If the owners do end up reading this, please do an overhaul and work on making your locations look clean and updated. the same pictures on the walls showing the food has not changed since i was there in the mid 90's and I'm sure they were there long before i was born. i know this place can do better so please do better as i would love to see you guys in business for many years to come.","date":1630375874000}

From the moment we decided to purchase this vehicle and taking a test drive, it's been a negative experience. However it ended with a positive result. We did leave with the vehicle as it's owner.  I received an email with the price out the door. However the listed amount didn't seem to settle well with a particular individual.  \n\nI didn't come up with this price and didn't force anyone to sell. I had it in writing and seemed like a good deal. \n\nWe had an appointment to see the vehicle and test drive. Once it was decided that we wanted to purchase, our newly appointed salesman had a different price tag. I quickly explained there must be a mistake. I matched vin numbers to my emailed confirmation thinking maybe I had driven or was discussing on different vehicle. After over an hr of waiting, sales reps were making phone calls to managers and these individuals were indecisive and delaying the process. I asked if there was something wrong with my paperwork. The response I kept getting was \"who told you this price?\"   I had paperwork present and even forwarded the email I received. \n\nThinking I was getting a deal maybe things were just off to a bad start. Wrong. I was asked to finance through the dealer on more than one occasion, after I had already provided the draft from my bank whom WE were financed with. Key word \"WE\" as in my wife and I. They figured I could get a better interest rate however we had piece of mind and knew we had made the correct decision  in financing prior to purchase. Comments displaying annoyance and frustration from staff members made this transaction even more uncomfortable. Again if there was a mistake on price made it wasn't on our end. \n\nDuring closing, comments were made that we didn't have our down payment in hundred dollar bills. The last time I checked US legal tender does come in multiple denominations. Counting 50's and 20's must've been difficult. As forms started being processed, my wife, mentioned that she should be signing the documents. Mr. New the finance manager responded \"it doesn't matter\" in a condescending manner. My wife was upset but Mr. New wouldn't have noticed. He never even bothered to make eye contact during the entire process. Hell, this man didn't even give us a hand shake. Regardless, it would've been bullshit anyways. \n\nWe drove to this establishment to purchase a vehicle and did exactly that. We didn't imagine we would be belittled in the process. The best part is after 3 days of owning the vehicle I'm receiving emails, texts that after everything they now need my wife's signature to complete this transaction on our banks end. Please try to imagine our reaction hearing this after how it all went down, especially when my wife was down graded in the finance office. My wife is a Veteran. She shouldn't be down graded. She's has served this GREAT COUNTRY for crying out loud. But some might consider that irrelevant however this why it's important to be kind regardless. \n\nIf this was a simple error that was overlooked and the transaction was pleasant, believe me, we would drive up to Port Richie to resolve this issue. My wife and I don't want to set foot in Ford of Port Richey EVER.  I've explain to members of staff that after being treated this way and to no fault of ours, WE WILL NO LONGER BE INCONVENIENCED. We drove up there to purchase the car. Due to incompetence I will not have my wife revisit that establishment and relive that experience. \n\nIt's a simple solution. Ford Mitsubishi of Port Richie needs my wife's signature.  Just like we drove to Port Richie because we needed a car Ford Mitsubishi can drive here and get her needed signature. \n\nI have contacted the GM as I have already submitted a request to speak with him regarding this fiasco. Along with this review on Yelp, I will also be submitting the same evaluation of this establish to Ford Motor Company.","date":1549867757000}

Restaurant was not as busy as usual when we came. For service, I give 2 stars. Came here couple times before in winter, extremely friendly and knowledgeable waiters were there, now looks like the restaurant switched to new staffs, they don't know that much about menu, they don't really care about customers. The waitress looked arrogant, took the wrong order, and never apologized for that. Water was never refilled until it was asked couple of times. \nWe waited for food really really long. We ordered couple dishes including rice noodle soup (pho) and rice dishes. The beef slices in pho were very tender, soup was very flavorful but was salty. Grilled sliced pork was the best out of food that we ate that day. We asked for extra sauce but it never came. The food tasted different compared to previous times that we used to come. \n\nOverall, I give food 3 out 5 stars, and for service 1 star.

I'm not sure. The bar staff is friendly and I've always been treated well there, even when I stick out like a sore thumb. I really enjoy catching an IU game there, as the crowds do not jam the good viewing points like they do at other bars. \n\nThe food here is decent. It's your basic bar menu, nothing too special.

Great holiday assortments, wine, drinks, premade dishes, and candy! The prices are high, but well worth it to me. I wouldn't do regular grocery shopping here ever.

They had 11 flavors of  ice cream the day I was there and 90 different syrups for the ices, including dye-free ones in case your kids are like mine and get the syrup all over their clothes.\nI had the Rum Haven ice cream (the sign stipulates 21+, so it must be alcohol-based) and my son ordered a combination chocolate ice cream with a root beer snowball on top, covered in vanilla cream sauce. Both  were excellent. I had my ice cream in a waffle cone made on premises and it was also delicious.\nI was pretty bummed when the Menchies went out of  business because the staff was usually pretty friendly and helpful.

Rob had been to a Fox & Hound in another state, so we decided to give this one a go. It had its ups and downs, but overall an OK pub to relax and have a few drinks. \n\nFriday night, and the place was dead. But I'm weird and I like having space to stretch my legs. Light music, low enough to chat with friends. There are two wings on either side of the bar where there's an abundance of seating, games and TVs. We decided to get some grub before getting into games. The drunken chicken tenders were sounding pretty good, and they were totally worth it! Beer battered chicken with some honey mustard. O.M.G. These things disappeared waaaaay too fast. Light, crispy batter covering moist chicken tenders. Ugh. I want some right now. So freaking good. \n\nThe drinks were a less impressive though. The specials that night included top shelf long islands. Ooooh, yes please! After two, I felt like I've just been drinking stale liquor all night. It just want doing it for me. Also, we tried getting some mozzarella sticks and a cookie desert, which kinda sucked. The sticks we're dry, and the cookie was seriously undercooked. But or waitress was so cool and replaced them with some more yummy chicken. \n\nOur waitress was super down-to-earth and easy to talk with. When we asked her what she thought of certain things in the menu, she answered truthfully. That's rare. But she was attentive, friendly and helpful.\n\nThe games include pool (about 6 tables), darts (4 boards with cricket scoreboards), cornhole, giant connect four and giant Jenga blocks. We had a blast playing darts for a change. The boards are in a cozy corner, away from the rest of the bar. The Jenga blocks sit on a coffee table surrounded by a leather couch and chairs. The decor is a more traditional sports bar look. Three to four TVs in each space with different channels playing different games. \n\nMaybe because we're getting old, but this place fit our needs fairly well. Not crazy loud or dark, and plenty of activities to keep you entertained...even when you're not drinking. I'd totally hit that again.","date":1438487676000}

They were so helpful for helping us choose flavors and even gave us extra ice when our snowball turned into soup. Out of the two I've had, both with a shot of rum, The Planter's Punch and the Rainbow, I definitely recommend the Rainbow! This is a flavor combination I've gotten many times in Hawaii and it reminded me of one of my favorite vacations. My friend likes both the Root Beer Float and the Better Butter Beer but if she had to choose one it would be the Better Butter Beer! The lovely Snowball Ladies mentioned that most of their customers are children. This is a great place for families but if you're a couple of college students like us and are looking for a booze-y dessert this is definitely a great experience and a very inexpensive treat.","date":1604071767000}

Just writing this review makes me want to take a walk on over there.  This little boutique on 2nd street in NoLibs has an exceptionally hand picked selection of clothing and accessories.  All of their garments only have 1-3 pieces of each style so it feels like a unique purchase.  They have great little books, candles, soaps... but only very original choices.  My favorite part has to be ALL the necklaces they keep up front mostly in a big glass counter.  There is something for everyone, yet somehow they tie the styles together in a way that makes it feel like you need EACH ONE OF THEM.\n\nGreat place to find a stand out gift, great place to find something for yourself for a special occasion (as their prices can be steep)","date":1371566125000}

Not to mention, some guy was randomly sitting outside, making me feel even more uneasy.\n\nI guess the only thing that could've helped would be the over the phone customer service. Whoever we spoke to, to book the room and give the courtesy \"no thanks\" call, was very rude. I would've hoped for a \"cheery\" over the phone personality, but that was far from it. It was a simple \"hey, what's the name? card number? OK, see ya then\" in a very unhappy tone. Then when we cancelled he just complained about how many times he could've booked the room. A real business owner would've known to give all those folks a call back to let them know a room was available and wished us well on our way and asked us what could've been done better.\n\nI'm not one to judge a book by its cover, but when safety's involved and I have a gut feeling, I tend to go with my gut.

This place is great. Since it's tucked into an industrial park area, you have to keep your eye out for it, but once you see it, you can tell this place looks all right. I was greeted by Lou, the friendly owner and the wonderful smell of smoked, cured meats as I walked inside. Lou was helping another customer but told me to look around for a bit and he would bring me some samples. He soon brought me a little plate with slices of different Hungarian smoked sausage and pork shoulder, as well as fontinella cheese. He also told me the specials of the day and offered me small samples of each. The sausage and cheese was delicious, and I decided to have a bowl of sauteed green peas, pigeon peas, onions and mushrooms for lunch. The fireplace-equipped dining room was decked out in warm colors lit up by plenty of natural sunlight shining through the window, making for a pleasant dining atmosphere. The peas came with a baguette-sized loaf of bread, which I used to mop up every last bit of sauce that was left on the plate. It was a simple dish, but loaded with flavor, a mouth-pleasing texture and a portion size that left a just-right feeling in my belly. Eastern European comfort food! Before I left, I had a great conversation with Lou and ended up buying some Hungarian sausage, horseradish cheese and a cake to take home. There's just something about going to a food business with a friendly, hospitable owner who describes his food to you well, but then gives you ample opportunity to try it for yourself before buying. I'm normally a shy, awkward customer on my first visit to an ethnic foods restaurant, but this guy made me feel very welcome and filled me full of good food. Do yourself a favor and stop by for lunch some time. I can't wait to go back.","date":1328298006000}

The movie was playing at 720 here, so we made the  trip from Nampa to Eagle.  \nI purchased my tickets online & the cost for 2 tickets after fees were $27. \nThe parkIng lot was huge and had plenty of spaces.  I think that there needs to be more lighting right after the entrance to the parking lot. They have several turns & dividers and it was difficult to see well at night.   That's not the tHeatre's fault, so I'm not mad.  Just an observation & suggestion. \nAs we entered the lobby, we were greeted by the delicious smell of freshly popped popcorn. It was immaculately clean.  There are several kiosks  that you can use to pick up and print your tickets that you bought online. For some reason they weren't working, so he had to get them when we ordered our refreshments.  \nWe ordered  a #3. It included a large popcorn & 2 large drinks. We were even able to upgrade our drinks to an Icee for only .49 cents. They also offer an insane amoUnt of Coca Cola drinks and they even offer CHEWY ICE! So, if you're like me and have an ice addiction, you will be very happy. \nOur movie was in Theatre #5. As we walked in, we not only noticed that we were the only people in the theatre, but there was nothing playing on the movie screen.  Our movie was scheduled to start at 7:20 and at 7:17, there still was nothing on the screen.  I made my husband go find someone to see if this was a normal occurrence. He was told that they don't always play anything on the screen prior to the movie start time.  It was a bit odd to say the least.  The movie started on time and the picture and sound were great. I had to leave during the movie to get a drink refill & i was pleasantly surprised that they have a separate counter right near the theaters for drink refills & snack bar service.  It's awesome to not have to go back to the lobby for this.  \nThe recliners were comfortable, but my husband and I agreed that we liked the Caldwell ones better.  The recliners in Caldwell recline more and the foot rest\/leg area is longer.  I am only 5'2\" and my feet hung over.  The seats do have a USB port in them so you can charge your phone during the movie. I thought that was a nice touch. \nOverall, we were very happy with our experience at The Luxe Reel! I wouldn't hesitate to come back again.  I'm confident that all of the little issues will be worked out as time goes on.  After all, this place is brand new!","date":1581494188000}

I'm probably going to give you more info than you need to know, but I feel like I should explain a bit.\n\nFirst off, I'm one of the organizers for a meet up group. We were contacted a few weeks back about getting a group in their one evening with the offer of 3 pizzas, endless chips and salsa, 50 wings, one of their pool tables for an hour, plus reserved sitting for the group. All I needed to do was show up with at least 10 people. I said we can do about 25-30, which we did.\n\nLast night we get there, and our section is reserved over in the room to the left. There was already a table of Michigan State fans - I was unaware there was a game on until we got there. Seems that's where the Michigan fans go. No problem since our tables were reserved and labeled as such. But more Michigan fans showed up and seem to be confused when we had to tell them are seats were for our group.\n\nOur server that night was Michelle, and she was very polite and prompt. Once we had  over 10 people there, she put in the order for free stuff. Additionally I got a classic burger and some other friends ordered food as well. And of course drinks. My burger was blah. It was tasteless and definitely of the frozen patty kind. The fries were fine. The free pizza - which free is awesome - was tasteless as well. I didn't try the wings, but the chips were, well chips.\n\nSo as far as the food goes. I wasn't unimpressed. On the plus side, our server was wonderful. She mostly took care of my group, with occasional help from others who really weren't much help to her, plus she had other patrons that night. And we didn't get freebies and things went as was offered.\n\nWhat also was disappointing was one of my friends said that earlier a different group who also had our waitress left without paying their bill. And the story is that the establishment makes the server foot the bill. That's really crappy in my opinion. That place is so busy and the set up in the main area I would describe as chaotic. So I can see how easily it is for a group to step out on a server and how is that her fault when she was working two different sections that night in a crowded restaurant\/bar?\n\nWhat sucked even more with that one of the meet up members had left without closing her tab. Michelle was trying to figure if she had left or not since none of us were certain and after awhile, we concluded she had. So we asked Michelle if she had an open tab or not, and she said yes, but that means she doesn't get a tip. I feel crappy that that happened to Michelle, and even though this woman was with my group, I didn't know her prior. Michelle never made us feel put out about it, but I feel frustrated that she busted her butt that night only to get stiffed along the way. They need to have a better way to handle these situations. Michelle did a great job and gets stuck with the short end of the stick.","date":1360514344000}

I wish I had read Yelp's reviews before making my reservations at Booking.com and HolidayInn.com. I booked two rooms for two nights last week. I agree with other's reviews at Yelp.com about staffers and manager. My biggest problem is their BED BUGS!!!\n\nOur rooms were not ready after 4pm, they told us \"there were accidents at the rooms\" we reserved over a week ago. Now I understood the \"accidents\" were \"bed bugs.\" So they knew the problems for those rooms, but they gave us at the last. I asked to speak to the manager, but the manager was not available.\n\nAs we were waiting in the backyard, we saw 3 homeless people sitting by the pool - had a boom box on, smoking by the table. Cigaret butts were floating in the pool No staff came to check on them. One old guy with swollen legs sit by the pool and dip his legs in the water. The other fat guy with hundreds red spots made a canon ball - jumped into the pool at the last, then a staff with red-cross vest came to talk to them.\n\nI thought my reservation included the breakfast, but they told me \"NOT\" but they gave a stratched coupon for \"one free breakfast\" for 2 rooms. Lucky enough, there were other places in Philly for breakfast. So many IHOPs in driving distance. I would give this Holiday Inn with 0 rating, if I can.","date":1378001102000}

The drivers showed up to my surprise with a Uhaul truck, I was under the impression they had their own supplies based on the website images and video where they say \"with our trucks all over Tampa Bay\".   The Florida Manager, Frank, arrived with them and introduced himself and provided a card in case I needed anything.  After being quoted $337 to move I was expecting better.  \nThe movers had everything done within the two hours.  When I was paying I was asked for a cash tip and to give a positive review on Google.  I thought it was rude to ask for a cash tip but I wasn't able to accommodate and put it on my card.  They thanked me, gave me the receipt and I went inside.  When I went back out to get items from my car I noticed a dent in the driver door.  The movers had hit it while leaving and didn't say anything.  I am unable to open the door, it is completely pushed in.  I attempted to call Frank at 757-513-7739 but it went straight to voicemail.  I called the office and spoke with Brian who informed me he couldn't do anything and was the only one in the office.  He explained that he would attempt to get ahold of Frank and to email him the pictures of the car to sales@bigboymoving.com (which I did at 12:35pm).   I finally spoke with Frank who instructed me to take the car to a shop, let me know what the price is going to be so he could put it on his credit card and take it out of the boys check.  I told him I did not feel comfortable with that and was already on the phone with our insurance and the police.    We spoke with the Uhauls claims department at 800-528-7134.   I spoke with Frank again to let him know what we were doing and requested a refund of at least my tip which was $50.00.  We were not able to complete anything until Monday.  On Tuesday we finally connected with the Uhaul claims department who explained the procedure.  \nI expected a call from Big Boys Moving Company but they did not call.  I called on Tuesday to find out the status of the issue and what the company was going to do.  I spoke Amanda who stated I would need to speak with Susan Anderson.  I requested to have her call me but I didn't hear anything, so I called back.  I spoke with Susan who was under the impression that everything was cleared up Saturday.  I stated that it was not and I was not happy that I would be out of a car for an extended period of time due to the insurance policy procedure and requested a full refund of $337 for the inconvenience and lack of customer service.  I also found out that I would have to pay out of pocket for the repairs until the insurance sent a check back.  Susan was more concerned with the car being out of commission for an extended period of time than the fact their movers hit my car.  She spoke in circles.  We ended our conversation and I received an email stating that they would have more information for me the next day.\nI ended up calling back on Wednesday 10\/12\/2016 because I had not heard for them and the Uhaul claims department called and informed us that Frank was denying any involvement.  After speaking with Susan and Frank I found out that because my partner and I do not share the same last name there was some confusion.  I requested for Frank to call the Uhaul claims department to clear up the matter. I requested a full refund again and she said that she was not able to approve it, and I requested to speak with someone who could.  Susan explained that the owners of the company pay her to talk to people so they do not have to.  I informed her that I was doing research on the company and found many complaints and that I would really like to speak with someone about my experience.  She stated that anyone can go online and write a report and that she was having a bad time on the phone with me she should go online and write bad comments about me.  I decided that was the last straw and said I would be contacting someone else to help me through the process.\nI still do not know the status of the insurance on the car, and who is paying for it.","date":1476815829000}

Hotel is very clean and nicely decorated,  definitely above average for a Holiday Inn..  great view of the stadiums out your window depending on which side your room is. subway stop is a few blocks away, a 10 minute walk past the stadiums, although not one to make alone after dark unless there is a game, because when there is no game no one is around the stadiums at night.  the Oregon SEPTA stop is also close and there is some on-street parking near it (it is also walking distance, but part of the walk to that station is under an overpass in an area with no people around so not something I would necessarily do at night, ask the hotel workers for advice on this)..  hotel restaurant and bar look pretty nice.. a fantastic place to stay if you are going to any game, but also a decent option for checking out Philly in general because price is much better than downtown and there is abundant free parking.  the subway to downtown does not run all night, i think the last train back leaves city hall about 1230 (depends on the day of the week too) but there is a bus that runs the same route that goes all night so if you go to bars in center city or south street you can use that to get back if you don't have someone to drive.

They even tried to blame the non existent weather conditions on the delay. BS! \n\nDelivery was horrible. You would think they would wear plastic on their shoes and be a little careful with the expensive mattress. It was just thrown around and shoved up our stairs scratching our wood floors. Just no respect for our new bed. Paid a lot of money for a bed but that is not reflective of the delivery service. I wouldn't pay a dime for the delivery service they offer. \n\nMy wife hates the mattress since we got it and I like it. It feels a lot different at your home than it did in the store. The setup instructions were a joke- they basically gave us a remote and made sure it went up and down while sweating everywhere. It seems relatively simple but I have no clue if this bed is working as it should or what features we may be missing.

The gal gave me major attitude when I politely asked her a question about my order. The aisles are pretty cramped, and it's often difficult to navigate the crowds. Their prices are less than competitive. Conversely, Rollin' Oats right down the street carries a wider selection of organic and non GMOs at better prices, and, to a person, their staff is always amazingly friendly, helpful and attentive.

Their menu can range from crispy egg noodles and noodle soups to lip-smacking rice dishes, rice vermicelli, and seafood. They also offer enjoyable vegetarian options. Depending on the day and time, their restaurant can be slightly empty or busy with customers but not too busy to be loud or crowded.\n Their service has a family aura and they are thorough when you're ordering, rereading everything that is ordered and checking if some ingredients is wanted. Their restaurant oozes with Vietnamese air, playing their music and displaying unique art pieces as well as souvenirs from Vietnam. I especially admired an art piece illustrating a dragon in the clouds. Its peculiar body intrigued me. When my ordered appeared of grilled pork chops and jasmine rice, it was nicely portrayed and cooked just right. The meat, juicy (especially with fish sauce drizzled over it) and the rice, slightly sweetened giving it flavor. However, when ordering a boba smoothie, it took a little longer compared to similar restaurants. We gave them a reminder and finally, our smoothie arrived. Even so, the boba wasn't as soft as I hoped for rather hard and too chewy. Though my juicy rice dish outweighed this small mishap. When asking for our check, they happen to forget about it.

I think my girl used at least four. And then tried to sell them all to me when I went to check out.

She was really pushing these products, and I wasn't crazy enough about any of them to buy them.\n\nI think I was in and out in about 60 mins. I went in the middle of the day on a weekday, so I'm guessing that is a slower time to visit. I purposely scheduled a blow out several hours before my interview, just in case.

Perfect for absorbing all the flavors of these delicious sandwiches. \n\nYou can tell this establishment uses fresh and high quality ingredients, because it makes a huge difference in taste.\n\nThe owner is almost always there and he is almost always cooking the food himself in the back. He's a very friendly guy, serving it up with a smile.\n\nThe bubble tea is also great and there is a decent selection.\n\nThe menu prices are very reasonable as the portions are generous.\n\nI hope this place does well, they really deserve it.","date":1552168196000}

I cant even begin to explain the number of issues I had with them. They completely ruined my moving experience, and made me never want to trust a moving company again. My move was from Tampa FL to TN. They gave me an estimate of $1300. I had a small one bdrm apt. They get there to move my things and want to charge me an extra $400 to wrap my things (which I was told was included with the estimate), because I had a box with my mattress (apparently \"Queen BED only includes a mattress price?) and my chairs were high chairs (which there wasnt an option for in the inventory). Anyway I agreed to the terms even though I was furious because I agreed to book them for their price and they couldnt give me an exact delivery date (for $1500 with another company I wouldve had one). So I was patient and understood that they couldnt give me an estimated day a month in advance but was told the driver that took my things would know. HE STILL couldnt exactly tell me but said it should be there Early in the week (mon\/tues) if not a week tops (thurs). When I hadnt received a call on MON I thought I should call to make sure they would be there by thurs because I had family coming up that weekend! Well they didnt answer their phone .. I called countless times and when I did speak to someone they gave me the run around and said that it should be there sat or SUn!! I was so upset because I started school that next week and could afford not to have my clothes... not to mention I couldnt cook or do anything without my boxes. Anyways they get there late on SUn and it had started to rain. I live on a hill in TN and the movers get there (im sorry MOVER it was only ONE GUY that was supposed move all of my furniture into the apt when FIVE moved it out) anyways he claims the my street is inaccessible!!! AND I HAD TO RENT A UHAUL. SO THAT MOFO MOVED MY STUFF FROM ONE TRUCK TO ANOTHER BY HIMSELF  - and then I had to move everything into my own apt!! WHAT WAS THE POINT OF EVEN SPENDING AN EXTRA $700 IF I HAD TO MOVE EVERYTHING MYSELF!??? It was a complete waste of money - - DO NOT TRUST THEM. They sounded very trustworthy because I spoke to the \"owner\" every time I called to discuss the move in the beginning, but its bull shit - they work for a bigger company \"van lines\" and a few days later when I am unpacking the kitchen i realize they took 2 boxes that had BRAND NEW PLATES AND CUPS ..

It's a hotel, no one is forced to stay there, but once people decide to stop staying there, they won't have a business anymore.  \n\nWe were also told that those who wrote similar reviews the SAME day were lying (smh). Tushar continued to yell at me, interrupt me, and finally hung up on me as if  HE was the one that was wronged.

They follow their leader. \n\nRegarding the clothes and essentials I had to purchase to cover my body because I literally had NOTHING to wear and nothing to put it in, nothing to brush my teeth with, nothing to wash my face with or body with, because all of the other hotels were sold out in the area, Tushar said he wants to call in his own people to come in and investigate before they compensate us for those items.

He demanded 1000 security deposit when we first booked and while my husband and I expected a full return, we get a check for $600 2 weeks after the wedding in the mail with not so much as a note or explanation. We got into it over the phone and he said he was going to mail 2 items we left because he didn't want me coming back to get them. When the package arrived at my house, the cross (one of the items) was broken. Thanks.

So delicious. \nI ordered the pork banh mi and my kid ordered the tofu banh mi. They were generous with the pickled daikon, carrots, jalapenos, cilantro and cucumber. The pork was seasoned perfectly and so juicy. I loved every bit of my sandwich. We also ordered fries. I started out with two orders and the lovely cashier told me that the serving size for the fries was large so we stuck with an order to share. I'm so glad she gave us the heads up. A huge plate of seasoned fries made it to our table. \nThis place makes me happy. The inside is cute, the service is sweet and the food is so very tasty.

You can find just about anything here, including the kitchen sink. The shop is a hidden gem on an old farm on the border of Indianapolis and Zionsville on 96th Street. There are three barns filled with amazing light fixtures, antique furnitures and any architectural feature that you can imagine. They have been salvaging these details from homes for decades. You can find parts (door knobs, hinges, crystals, stairs, flooring, glass shades and much much more).  Outside, wroth iron fencing and porcelain tubs. Sometimes you have to look through the dust to find the treasures. \n\nParts are fairly well organized - and the staff can help you find something that you are looking for. \n\nThe buildings are old barns and not easily accessible for strollers or wheelchairs.

I am so glad I did because I had a five-star experience.\n\nThis cafe opened up a little over two months ago, but it stands strong with quality customer service and unique charm.\n\n[Food]\nI ordered a small vegan (tofu) banh mi with a side of fries. My total only came out to $6.75 and the portion was more than generous -- I had a bunch of fries leftover to take home. The fries were not at all greasy. Instead, they were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Plus, the seasoning is addictive. The owner offered me ketchup, which I found very endearing. The banh mi was flavorful, packed with fresh vegetable and packaged with care. The tofu was very filling and delicious.\n\n[Drink]\nThe owner generously gave me a milk bubble tea on the house and I was so very thankful. I believe they use non-dairy creamer which is good for me as a newly vegan, lactose-intolerant gal. It satisfied my sweet tooth! The tapioca pearls are a bit softer here than other places, which makes it even easier to finish the drink top-speed.\n\n[Service]\nThe main reason for my five-star review is the customer service. The owner, his brother and the cashier were all very kind, funny and charming. They work harmoniously together. Almost seems like I was invited to a family meal.\n\n[Tips]\nThey have a $10 CARD MINIMUM. Bring cash! Also, the owner invited me to come again in a few weeks or so to try pho! There will be a vegetarian option!","date":1546118055000}

The stock is terrible, the place is understaffed and clearly not motivated- and the last time I was out there, I promised myself I'd never go again. And I won't.\nIt's sad and scary how much plastic and polyester crap is cluttering up the place, with little if any decent-quality merchandise available.\nVirtually every aisle had merchandise laying on the floor, creating not only a safety hazard but an impossible shopping experience. I brought this to the attention of the barely-old-enough-to-vote manager on duty, and the deer-in-the-headlights look in his eyes left me with precious little confidence that my concerns would ever be addressed.\nThe women's clothing racks are skimpy at best, ridiculously bare at worst. If you don't love polyester, you might as well not even bother looking. The Five Points store is better stocked; but still, that's not saying much, unless you REALLY like polyester. \nThe security guards have a bigger presence than the sales people. There's a bare minimum of checkout clerks working, which I can understand, because it's rare that there are ever more than a couple of people in line, winding their way through a labyrinth of candy and plastic water bottles for sale, to tempt your crying children while you wait.\nOn rare occasions when they first opened, you used to be able to find some decent housewares, a wall mirror, artwork- and at the perfectly right time even some bargains on shoes. \nBut nowadays, the shoes are wired up with so many anti-theft tags, cords and wires that a bomb squad would have trouble untangling them. There is apparently no simple way to try a pair of shoes on and take a short walk in them, without going to the checkout lines first and waiting until you can get someone to 'cut the cords' for you. \nIt's a shame, really. The concept was good at one time, but nowadays everything seems to have gone downhill in the search for the cheapest goods to be sold at the cheapest price, while paying your employees the least possible wages, unconcerned about their low morale (...and yes, I talked several of them; they're miserable, but \"a job is a job\", especially in this town), and the omnipresent highest concern for preventing theft. \nAnd if you're wondering where the plastic that's choking our oceans literally to death is coming from, look at the products and the packaging in this store. \nWhen do we say \"enough\"?","date":1533434387000}

I am involved with direct patient care in my career and I know the difference between quality care and apathy, Brandon Family Medical provides 5 star patient care. \n\nYes, sometimes there is a wait, but people, thats not necessarily a horrible thing.  Just think, when you are in the exam room and Dr. Davis shuts the door, you have his undivided attention for as long as it takes. This is NOT cookie cutter healthcare. This is what real healthcare looks like. Patients don't all fit into a 10  minute time slot, humans are complicated. I would imagine you would want him taking his time with you. \n\nI cannot speak about the other physicians, this review is about Dr. Davis, office staff, PA David, nurses and nursing assistants. \n\nDo yourself a favor, get sick and go check out the care you get there!!","date":1384751358000}

I had to follow up a few times a week for another few weeks to get them to take any action on it.  Their solution?  Treat for fungus and wait for the lawn to come back!

I was lucky enough to be invited to a wedding reception at Artesano's. The venue consists of two floors and felt very spacious but at the same time very intimate. We walked into the space and were greeted by employees who held the door open for us and offered to take my umbrella and put it in an umbrella bag for me (it was pouring that night!) There was a band playing acoustic music when we entered and was playing throughout the cocktail hour. The cocktail hour was actually my favorite part of the whole night. The main table had fresh fruit, baked brie, fig jam, toasted bread, cheese, and crackers. The Brie and fig jam were my favorite. They even had a server dedicated to serving the brie. Some of the appetizers included mini Caesar salads in a cheese shell, bacon wrapped scallops, Philly cheesesteak egg rolls, green eggs and ham (it sounds weird but it was great), jumbo shrimp in wonton wrappers, mussels, and many more. There was servers constantly bringing around appetizers for the guests. I hate when there isn't a enough appetizers to go around and you feel like you're waiting for the next plate to be near you so you can pounce on it. I loved the variety and that they kept coming at a good pace. The only thing I wish came around more often was the signature drink the bride chose. I felt bad asking the bar to make it even though the bartender told me they were bringing more out to be served (I only saw them go around once). Not a big deal! The bartenders were fast - I didn't have to wait in any long line and there were about 250 guests at this wedding. I believe this is a bring your on liquor\/beer place, but they do make the food in house. After cocktail hour ended, we went up stairs to the second level for dinner. The art work is amazing. I especially loved iron banister leading up to the second floor. Dinner was amazing -  we were given a seeded roll and a delicious salad. I couldn't tell you what kind of salad it was but it was something else. For my entree I had the jumbo lump crab cake and so did my partner. I got to taste the filet (which was the other dinner choice) and that was great too. They were served with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. Servers brought around red and white wine a few times during our meal, which was nice. The dance floor was all the way at the other end off the second floor (you have to climb down some steps to get to it). It was a decent size, and I felt like there was plenty of room. Dessert and coffee was served on the first floor in a room off to the side of the entrance. The mini desserts were great - carrot cake, key lime pie, chocolate ganache, and cheesecake. They even opened up another bar area in the dessert room (that was a pleasant surprise). Every employee I encountered during the reception was friendly and happy to serve us. I'd definitely recommend this venue to friends, and I hope to be invited to another event here!","date":1543373222000}

I looked over the car tested in and confirmed that Ii wanted it. then I asked for the price. The sales clerk would not give me the price and insisted I give him my personal information first. I asked again for the price, again he refused to give me one, Then another man came over and said he heard the discussion and would give me the car for 5K, if I agreed to buy the car, of course, I agreed to purchase the car cash. I gave the clerk my info, then the man came back a few minutes later and stated 2 minutes had passed and the car was now over 20K and I would be giving him 5K today and finance the car. The Internet price with their trumped-up $2600 in dealer fees and tax did no total to over 20K.

I didn't want anything high-end, just a small place nearby was all I was after. Pro Hair & Nail Care Salon looked like an acceptable choice!\n\nWhen I walked in here I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into. I think there was a bachelorette party there getting pedicures, and there was also a group of young girls there getting their nails done for a middle school dance. Regardless of the crowd, I was quickly approached by a friendly lady who directed me to a pedicure chair in the back. Both groups were leaving at that point (phew!) so it was quieter and a little more peaceful. \n\nThe lady who was taking care of me turned the water on and walked away for a few minutes and the water was so... hot...! She finally came back and felt it and realized that my feet were probably burning. I was a little grossed out, too, because there was a strand of hair floating in the water. Yes, I'm serious. So I just closed my eyes and went to my happy place. This is about the time when the funniest thing possible happened.\n\nI'm a contemporary dancer so the bottom of my feet are different from most people's (I'll save the details) and my lady looked at my funny because I didn't want her to try to fix that as I need my feet that way to dance. She asked me about it and I told her I was a dancer, and she got a really funny look on her face. Then she asked... \"Stripper?\" No, nail lady, I'm not a stripper! Dear God. All I could do was laugh. I think she surprised herself when she asked that. \n\nThis place is definitely not fancy, but ironically, I walked out of there with the best looking nails I've ever had, which prompts the question... would I go back? Honestly, I probably will. My nails look that good.\n\nI'll leave my stripper shoes at home, though.","date":1295709133000}

I was looking for some decent-quality, sturdy plastic tote boxes\/bins. I like the Rubbermaid brand Roughneck ones due to the big handles, thicker plastic, and snap-on lids but they are expensive! Here, they're $7.70 each. That's $1-3 cheaper than the bulk pack from Lowes, Home Depot, or even Walmart. AND I didn't have to wait for them to be shipped to me! \n\nBig Lots sells closeout items and I got my Earth Boxes here last year for just $25. I've never had such success in my small garden! They also sell reconditioned items that have been repackaged and look like new, like vacuums. They DO sell furniture, decor, and household goods that appear to be manufactured specifically for them...but you'll also find closeouts from Pier 1, Bed, Bath, and Beyond, or Linens & Things on occasion. \n\nThe food section is pretty great. Lots of international items and a HUGE bargain for Bob's Red Mill stuff. Sometimes the stuff is close to or past the best-by date but this isn't the norm. If it is past the best-by date, it's deeply discounted. I picked up 4-packs of no-sugar-added applesauce this week for $1 each. \n\nI have purchased curtains and curtain rods here as well. For the most part, I find the items to be higher quality than Walmart or Kmart but at lower prices. \n\nLots of seasonal items. If you're looking to buy small trees, rosebushes, flowering shrubs, hostas, bulbs, etc. check out their selection. I bought some last year (on clearance even!) and they're blooming again this year. \n\nAll in all, a great place to save some money on necessities and things you might want but don't quite need.","date":1399652878000}

I was assured I would be in and out in 30 minutes--45 minutes tops. Appointment was at 6:00--at 7:15 I was still a long way from being finished. When  I asked her how much longer and she said at least another thirty minutes I had to stop her and rush home to do it myself. I explained before we started I needed to be someplace at a certain time and she said no problem.  When she was having such a hard time and I was coming up on the hour mark she said that the web site was wrong and that no one was in and out in only 35 minutes.  (note--the place wasn't busy at all--we started on time, this poor woman was just in over her head)  My hair isn't difficult--shoulder length and only wanting a smooth and bouncy blow out-nothing complicated. Stylist was extremely nice, very cheerful and yet almost too cheerful.  Uncomfortable questions including, do I know the owners? (uh, no. would it matter if I did?) and was full of information about her other clients and her co-workers.   I think she might be new as she hit me in the head with the dryer several times and was very unsure of herself when trying to hold the hair with a brush and style. When I left my hair was saturated with product and was an over teased over the top dried out looking mess. Really disappointed in the service--they didn't charge me but I still left a VERY generous tip and was somewhat surprised that no one ever even followed up.

So I told him that it was fine & asked him if I could just place an order now & pick it up later. He said no, I'd have to go order off-line & come back later. The problem is that their ordering system only runs through the Internet. You can't make a phone-call or place an order in person because they're system of paying & ordering currently doesn't work that way. For some reason this all revolves around their cash register. I have yet to discover why. Stupid right? This place is located at 34th & Spruce & I live no where around there so I had to cart myself home, order on the internet, & go back 30 minutes later to pick it up.

The quotes were the same as Christian HVAC gives, but at least they included filters, so far so good. I decided to give them a try on a single furnace cleaning job. The guy comes in and tests some electrical cables. He tells me the burners are rusty and the ignition is inconsistent. He starts to scare me that this is not safe and may need to turn off the gas. He does not do any cleaning of the furnace, no removal of burners or anything, because in his opinion it was not worth it, or they could break when he removed. I let him talk with his boss and he switched off the gas (remember, middle of winter with snow storms). I pay him in cash plus some tip. The next day he follows up all happy with three quotes for new furnaces. Starting price ~$5,600 for a crappy single stage furnace, and top price ~$8,500 for a two stage furnace with variable speed blower )all Trane brand). He also came to my house a second time, this time as a salesman. He never checked the rest of the system, never put the head outside to check the heat pump for compatibility, never checked the rest of the house to see if the size of the furnace was appropriate. Just sat on a couch and had some good time, like a tired tech turned salesman.\n\nI started to get quotes from other companies down in Philly, and guess what, they were much much lower. I changed a little later to a Carrier Performance 59tp6 (two stage burning with variable speed blower) for $4,000, half of what Service First wanted to pitch me.\n\nBut the story continues. I decide to give Service First another try to do maintenance on my systems (I have two furnaces and two heat pumps). I call them and I ask if they are interested in setting up a maintenance program with a minor discount since the tech did not do the whole cleaning job the first time. They took their time to think about it and called the next day. Apparently Brian, the owner, said that I had not paid anything the first time. I explained that I had paid the tech in cash and left tip. They didn't know what to say, but they promised they would follow up the day after. Since then, I have never received a phone call.\n\nThis is why my conclusion is that, after contacting many Bucks County companies, I can spot these typical companies much better. They rely on the fact that Bucks County has higher income families usually, so they pitch much higher prices that companies in Philly do. They usually will state that their service is great. They may even lie to you that they are an exclusive Trane dealer and Trane does not allow them to install other furnaces (that's what I was told) but they lie through their teeth. None of the furnace brands force HVAC companies to use only their brand. I can tell you this because I talked with multiple companies, and I installed my Carrier furnace with an official Carrier installer listed on the Carrier webpage, and they also confirmed that there is no exclusivity to furnace brands.\n\nStay away from these people and do not trust easily good reviews. People may be happy of their choice when they don't do their job of looking for alternative quotes, but Service First is just typical Bucks County company that costs double the price of companies that can come from Philly to do the same job.","date":1623360222000}

A very pretty red head who had an incredibly positive disposition. I spoke with her about her business. She informed me of the new changes, Namely the change in management which I was very ecstatic about.\n\nThe next changes she informed me about were the menu. I took a look and placed an order. I ordered their signature \"Recovery Room\" burger. It is a mixture of beef and hot sausage which gives it an extra kick. I made sure my burger was dressed with all the fixin's and topped with pepper jack cheese which gave it a little extra spice! I substituted their fries for some onion rings. The burger was fantastic, and it was so big that I actually could not finish it. The onion rings were good too, they were nice and crispy just the way I like it. They also came with some spicy dipping sauce. My hats off to the blonde lady in the kitchen, she did a good job cooking my meal.\n\nThis is the 4th bar and grill that has been here in this very location. I don't know if some Voodoo witch doctor put a curse on this location but the last 3 businesses had some bad luck here. I told the bartender the same thing that I told the last 2 business owners,\"You got a good thing going here don't screw it up\".

The art that covers the walls, the unique furniture, the extra little touches (Artesano actually added some beautiful flowers and other details for us without charge, which was such a rare and greatly appreciated treat) made every moment fun and interesting. Plus, every single picture (both our professional photos and those take by our friends) look stunning. We opted to forgo any flowers (partially based on the staff's counseling that they can make the room look to busy) and did centerpieces of mismatched golden Mercury candles with custom table signs--the candles (900!) were gorgeous and were the perfect complement to the rest of the decor. \n\nFOOD: The food...oh the food! We are obviously biased, but this was the best wedding food we have ever had. The passed appetizers (duck pastrami, beef short rib crostini, rare tuna, veg summer rolls, etc.), food stations (delicious and unique Mediterranean dishes like dolmades and falafel), the salad, entrees (ribeye and halibut with potatoes and asparagus), and desserts (cake plus a whole assortment of mini pies), were just unbelievably good. Trays of our signature cocktails awaited guests as the left the ceremony room. The bartenders served everyone quickly. Everything about the food and drink was spot on. \n\nSTAFF: Overall, the staff was terrific throughout the event. They made sure the pre-ceremony ran smoothly, added nice ceremony touches (like the dramatic closing and opening of the room's doors for the bride), and were attentive to guests' needs. Megan again shined in this area as she prepared us for entering the ceremony and kept in touch about details as the night progressed.\n\nDIFFICULTIES: Working with Artesano did not come without difficulties, and there were also some issues we faced during our wedding day. \n* Artesano cares deeply about the venue and its appearance--that means that you will work collaboratively to design the space and the event. It is a conversation, not an opportunity for the Bride & Groom to simply dictate what they want. For example, we had decided on one location for our DJ and when we arrived on wedding night, the DJ was in a different place--it worked really way but was not what we initially wanted. We ultimately found this dynamic to be mostly a good thing, since the appearance was fantastic and Artesano knows their venue well, but you should know about that dynamic coming in.  \n* On the day of, we faced a few complications. \no There was a miscommunication, which led to some of our set-up team having to take on additional work. \no Some of our guests found at least one staff member to be rude during a number of interactions--Artesano has some big personalities, which rubbed some of our guests the wrong way. \no The venue will only open 15 minutes before the ceremony starts unless you pay an additional cost. This tight timing was frustrating for some guests, especially since it was raining. \no Our night ended up running an hour behind schedule. This was due partly to the ceremony and speeches going longer than expected, but the delays were not communicated and both cut into dancing time and left guests without entrees for longer than expected (this partially had to do with our event size--215 guests--which was on the larger side of what they can accommodate).   \n\nAgain, overall, our experience was really wonderful. We do strongly recommend Artesano--it is an exceptional venue with a great staff and a top-notch chef that will offer you an incredible wedding experience. Just know that it comes with some quirks.","date":1494348864000}

This was my FIRST time ordering from them and it will be my LAST! I read some reviews that they have bad customer service, but good foods. I wanted to give them a chance so I placed an order for 5 dumplings and Cheesesteak noodles and within a minute the employee call me saying they don't have the noodles. They didn't fix the menu before I placed the order. So he offer $10 worth of dumplings or refund. I said I want a refund. So within a few minutes he gave me partial of my refund. I call back and said I want a full refund and I thought the order was cancel. He said the order went out already and he can't do anything about it. So he said they can give me a refund on the 5 dumplings that was sent out and I can keep it because I don't think that it is right that I should pay more than double the price on it because of delivery and fee added. He recommend that I call Grubhub for refund of the fee and delivery because they can't refund that. I got my order quick and the foods was horrible to! Dumplings is an Asian appetizer. I should of known to just order from an Asian restaurant instead of American. \n\nI waited for the rest of my refund, but it took awhile so I called Humpty's Dumplings again and they won't pick up my call.

She said she will try again and said she was able to refund me through Grubhub and not them. Judy recommend next time I should report the incident first if it happened again.

I knew it was there but I thought it was only a wedding venue so I never bothered checking it out. I stumbled across it again during covid because my friend was looking for a late night coffee spot. We saw people sitting outside drinking wine so we decided to go inside to see if they had any coffee.\n\nThe inside is very confusing. On the first floor, they have a wide open room that's pretty empty, a plant shop with a cafe and upstairs is an art gallery. When we walked inside, it took us a minute to find an employee who said that they do have coffee. The employee also said that since covid, they had to offer more than just an event venue so they opened up a cafe with pastries and served wine.  They recently started offering dinner as well. \n\nHad I known that Artesano served wine and food, I would've visited much sooner! The outdoor section is really cute and cozy with plenty of heat lamps. The inside is very spacious and you can sit anywhere (all of the furniture is available for sale). The upstairs is an art gallery which you're able to freely walk around. I haven't tried the food or wine yet, but I look forward to it. This has the potential to be one of my go-to spots in Manayunk!

I have never had an issue until recently with one particular employee \"G. Myers\". The times that I have come in to drop off, she is chain-smoking outside while yapping away on her phone. My first awful experience, she kept me waiting for over two minutes as she continued her phone call, but not before coming in, reeking of cigarettes and still blabbing on her phone saying that \"she had to help a customer\". It was almost as though it was an inconvenience that she was having her do her job. Giving her the benefit of the doubt, I tried to make pleasantries in case it was an important phone call. Well, that did nothing. She had a rude attitude, has never been told the concept of customer service, and was just plain arrogant. It was during this experience that I noticed she did not update my overall laundry weight to account for the weight of my laundry basket. I had to bring it to her attention, which she then reluctantly updated so to charge me the accurate weight of my laundry.\n\nToday when I went to drop off, she was blasting her phone and watching a video, and again was very annoyed that she had to help me. As she goes to check me in, she recalls my basket weight, but only reduces the poundage by 2... for my large laundry basket. From my previous experience, I made a point of weighing the basket on my scale at home, and identified that it was actually 4 pounds and not 2 pounds. I let her know this fact, and she told me that there was nothing she could do but that the next time I came in she would give me an extra discount. I told her that seemed silly and to cancel and start a new transaction, to charge the true weight, which she reluctantly did. \n\nWhen I go to pick up my laundry this afternoon, she had left a passive aggressive note on my receipt receipt stating that my basket actually weighs 2.5 pounds and not the 4 that I stated. Basically insinuating that I'm a liar, and that my basket did not weigh as much as I said it was. Don't blame me, blame my scale at home.\n\nPerhaps these issues and her awful attitude seem trivial, but when you're trusting someone with your clothing by paying to have them cleaned, it is unsavory to have an unkept, smelly employee who seems to not care less about whether or not she charges the right amount or even does a proper job. It wouldn't surprise me if I inspected my clothing and they were damaged, or items were shrunk after this experience.\n\nDo yourself a favor, and take your business elsewhere.","date":1554419380000}

His personal touch and follow up was wonderful and gave me peace of mind that our kitties were in good hands.

To be honest, we weren't really at the hotel THAT much, but the time I spent there was pleasurable. Nice rooms, friendly staff, clean and from our room, we had a terrific view of Citizens Bank Park. We did not visit the bar, however there is a Starbucks\/gift shop in the lobby that sports decent prices. I bought a bottle of OJ expecting to pay $3 or $4 and only ended up paying $1.50. \n\nIf I had to complain about anything, I'd nitpick about the parking. We were there during a game night and at about 3 or 4 o'clock, attendants rope off the parking lot, making it a bit tricky to find the entrance, especially for out of towners. Other than that, when we got back in the evening, the ropes were down and the parking was spacious. I also agree with the other reviewer who said that the hotel was in the middle of nowhere. If you stay here and you're having late dinner after a ball game or a show, try Ralph & Rickey's Pizza, a very good quality pizza with a decent price and the only plae that will deliver to this hotel that late.","date":1433270555000}

I also noticed that they are better controlling the froyo temperature, so it's been a nice firm consistency now! \n\nThe fruit selection is really good but could be better. I get their fresh fruits such as the strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, and kiwi. Their mango and pineapple are unfortunately frozen\/canned. I think their raspberries too? Another topping I am fond of is their ground flax seeds (newly added). Not sure if this a new thing with froyo shops, but I get it  every time for a mega nutrition boost. \n\nAnother great plus is that they give students a discount!

Oh, HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE!\nAfter reading the reviews of this hotel prior to making reservations for the 2017 Army-Navy Football game, I took them as reviewers being disgruntled about minor things.  Well they were spot on with their reviews of this well-below average hotel.\nLet's start with reservations.  I have never dealt with a hotel that raised the rates AFTER booking the rooms!!!! They knew they had all of us because it was Army\/Navy weekend.  Over $900 for 2 night!  Original price was $275 a night.  And the worst part is that they know people will stay there for the convenience so they have no incentive to improve their customer service, their rooms or the REALLY awful restaurant.  \nNext, the horrible and honestly dangerous front desk staff. They have individuals that work the desk do not have a level of proficiency with the English language to handle the crowds.  After speaking with the employee and spelling the name multiple times, the employee kept understanding it as a different name not even close to correct.  He kept trying to give us someone else's reservation and room before telling us he had no reservation at all.  Eventually his co-worker finally got it corrected.  2 members of our party arrived separate from the group.  Neither name was on the reservation, but they gave the front desk the name on the reservation and the front desk gave them a key for the room.  No request for identification or anything.  What if they had not been in our group?  The following day after forgetting the key in the room while preparing to attend the game in the snow, I could not get a key. I gave the name of everybody on the reservation and the room number.  I could not get a key to the room unless someone on the reservation called and approved it!! Total lack of consistency.  Friday they let anyone into any room with no ID and Saturday, stickler for the rules.\nNow, let's talk about the hotel restaurant\/sports bar.  Considering this hotel is located a 5-10 minute walk from Lincoln Financial Field (home of the Eagles), Citizens Bank Park (home of the Phillies), Wells Fargo Center (home of the 76ers and Flyers), and the next 2-years for the Army-Navy game, lots of work needs to be done.  We overheard the staff acting surprised that the bar was so crowded the morning of the game and the night afterwards.  It was like they didn't know or care that there would be hundreds of people in this hotel that particular weekend.  The bar was way understaffed and they ran out of basic things like Miller lite, chicken wings and nachos.  How do you have a limited menu of typical Sports Bar fare and then run out of the 2 main staples of a sports bar (wings and nachos)?!?!?!?!? HEY, THIS GAME IS GOING TO BE HERE FOR THE NEXT 2-YEARS, MAKE BETTER PLANS FOR THE LARGE CROWDS!!!!!  With the exception of 1 bartender and the hostess, the staff that was there acted like they didn't want to be there. Our waitress was exceptionally bad.  We sat for a long time before she came to the table and when she did come, she never smiled and despite attempts to be nice to her, she was awful to us the whole time.  Our group ordered: Chicken Caesar Salad (chicken undercooked), cheeseburger & fries (burger was cold as well as the fries, cheesesteak (meat was dried and bread could break a window it was so hard), and (2) chicken strips & fries (flavorless and soggy).  Overall the food was bad, slow and the service was awful.  The hostess who bent over backwards to help all staff and patrons in the bar that night was very apologetic and very embarrassed.  She was the silver lining of a very bad experience.    \nI inform all of you, DO NOT STAY HERE!!! Convenience of being by the sport venues is great but that is all!!!  We go to the Army\/Navy game every year and we will not EVER stay here again.","date":1513628032000}

Its hard to find a good Vietnamese spot around here and this place is definitely one.\n\nLets start with the errors i found:\n\nCa Phe Sua Da (Vietnamese Coffee): can definitely be better not as strong as it should be and is too reliant on the condensed milk for flavor. Vietnamese Coffee is known for its strength and fragrant aroma.\n\nThere was a strange odor in the air when we came into the restaurant but it wasn't too bad to interrupt our meal.Finally the price is really expensive but i expected something of the sort for the area it is in. a bowl cost roughly 9 dollars average depending on what you are ordering. \n\nA Meal for two cost us $31.25 with two drinks one appetizer and 2 entrees. (In the best places in south Philly it costs roughly 25 dollars for all that)\n\nOK now the Goodies:\n\nThe Goi Guon was excellently made, not like it can be messed up... but i have seen it done before. so this dish pleased me a lot since it was the first to come out and clear my wariness.\n\nPho was excellent, found little or no trace of MSG.\n\nBun Bao Hue was excellent as well they captured the flavor i was craving and had little or no MSG. it pleased me they got everything right and the condiments were as fresh as can be. only downside to this was that they used the wrong kind of meat for this dish but it still tasted good (another reason for 4 stars and not 5)","date":1314740894000}

This omelette tasted downright healthy and was very filling. The grits were cooked perfectly.\n     The real star of the show here were the scratch made biscuits.

They no longer have dinner specials, and the dinner tasted like it was microwaved. It's convenient for Fishtown folks, but I couldn't help but think the whole time I was eating that I could've cooked something at home much better than what was on my plate. Service was also not friendly. No refill offered on drink. Our server was pretty much on break when we were eating... he was eating too.\n\nOLD REVIEW: This diner is near our house so it's convenient, but more importantly it is dependable. It's the best option in Fishtown for a quick, full meal whether at breakfast brunch or dinner. I like coming for dinner because they always have about 20 dinner specials. All fresh - favorite thing to get is the BBQ chicken and shrimp. It comes with soup salad and vegetables.. You literally can't ask for more. Any server here will always take care of us like getting a refill before we even have to ask. Also, since the diner is relatively new, it's really clean. I look forward to continuing to come here.","date":1431736092000}

As you can imagine, week after week of hotels gets expensive- and boring. I did a little research and found Gram's Place. What a find! It's not your average...well, anything! Its an eclectic somewhat \"hippy-style\" lodging where you will not be lonely or bored. Its been described as \"a cross between Key West and Amsterdam\". \n\nI stayed in two different rooms, what are now called the \"Blues Room\" and in the \"Adventure Room.\"  The Blues Room was located in the main house and has a really old kitchen that they call the \"I Love Lucy\" kitchen. The Adventure Room was basically a shed with bunks. Both were totally adequate- comfortable bed with clean linens and facilities. You can certainly rest your head here. Breakfast was \"fix it yourself\" at the time, now you can bring your own cereal or head out and grab. \n\nThe Jacuzzi was very nice and welcome after a long day at work. Best of all though, was the free and easy atmosphere and the music that fellow guests played. It was like staying with a friend. \n\nIf you are open-minded, not in need of much amenities and would like to feel more \"at home\" than \"on the road\" check it out!","date":1232657878000}

You got the Se7en, the El Cortez, the 2nd West Street, Vanguard, Waterfall and a couple of local nightclubs just within the same 4 or so city blocks. These clubs change their owners so much that you can't even remember what they used to be called, but for some reason it always remains the same after changing hands. \n\nHowever, I can't help to be honest that... also because of where it is located at, customers are going to face a lot of rough attention from the worst of the worst of Reno's locals. You got bums lurking in the alleys on your way there, and meth-head child molesters mingling with teenage youngsters at \"The Circle\" on the Riverwalk, right in plain view of the outside patio. During the summer cops get called alot to settle fights that jump off at the skate park 1 block east, and all along the Riverwalk. Alot of the homeless, which happens to be a very prominent issue in Northern Nevada, are going to be VERY BOLD, bold enough to go inside and start bothering you for change and cigarettes. \n\nI only liked half the staff, and it was because of their straightforward but relaxed personalities. Alot of people who reviewed this place complain about slow customer service, but I really didn't mind. It's a place that you are going to sit down with a laptop for a couple of hours and take your time doing stuff. If you wanted speedy customer service and in-and-out coffee, just go to a Starbucks Drive-Thru instead. It's really slow and relaxed. Don't come here for a cup of joe on your lunch break. You'll feel very tempted just to stay and lounge around. \n\nEvery Monday night they have a poetry, music, and art event called Open Mic Night. Alot of teenagers and young adults from college just volunteer themselves to the event, and most of them are regular customers. \n\nAround the afternoon, this place turns into a drama filled \"bar\" for little kids. It's a real mixed bag and definitely not something people should be coming every day for. This place has favoritism over a couple of folks that have been showing up here for years, most are really cool, others are alot of drama. \n\nIf I came back up to Reno from Vegas, I might stop by, but I am really old now and hanging at Java Jungle was probably the best and worst time waster I ever regularly went to.","date":1324486971000}

I can't believe someone like that is managing the hostel. I was a visitor that got invited by a guest there and as I stayed waiting in the living room he stared me down and I was uncomfortable because I didn't know who he was. He then gave me attitude and asked me if I checked in with him. I said \"no, I'm with my friends (I said her name) then he looked at me like like I didn't know what I was talking about. I was so confused. He then said \"well you still have to check in even if you're a visitor\". At that point I felt so uncomfortable by this man's unnecessary attitude. I said \"ok\" then he proceeded by saying \"ok well let's go then\" he rudely pointed to the door so I can go with him to check in as a visitor. As I did I went to his office and begin to write down what he wanted me to write down. Then he goes \" you wrote down 'guest' when you where supposed to write down 'visitor'\" then I said \"sorry, it's been a long night\" he then said \"just write down the date where it said date.\".

Later as she's showing me the hostel we see him and then he goes \"you want a tour\" I said \"no thank you\". He then Looked at my friend and proceeded by saying \"I tried\" and then sits down, she continues to give me the tour. Honestly, I don't know what his deal is or why he thinks it's ok to talk to someone that way, but if that's how he goes about people that could potentially bring him business than he should just quit hospitality all together and get a job that does not involve human interaction.

On the night we went they had 3 dollar wheat beers. If you like sports bars, you'll dig the decor. \n\nThe bad: food was overpriced and reminiscent of Applebee's quality. My burger, ordered medium, was not the slightest bit pink and was super, unbelievably dry. It lacked flavor utterly and completely. A ten dollar burger should be juicy, well-seasoned, and if possible cooked to order. Additionally the bun was on the stale side, and my 'sauteed onions' were just plain raw. Just so very hum-ho. It was the signature burger, too. Hate to think what a non signature burger tastes like. \n\nThe gentleman with me ordered the fish and chips. They were a step above the burger in flavor, and for the 9 dollar price range he felt he was given a more than generous portion of fish. A little soggy and salty for me, but I would order it  if I ended up here again.\n\nLast, there were a couple of flies buzzing about while we ate...not a deal-breaker but certainly not charming.\n\n\nMy advice is to stick local and avoid chains...even if Groupon tries to get you to do otherwise!","date":1342055528000}

I was always using my dads clubs (old ping blades) and figured it was time to get a set of my own. I went down to T&D and bought a used set of Ping G5s. Something just felt off about them and I was hitting the ball inconsistent. I learned the importance of club fitting and decided to give GOLFTEC a call. I chatted with Don Costanzo about the process and decided to go in the same day. He took my measurements and had me swing a few times to get some numbers on the board. Turns out that the Ping G5's work perfect with my swing, however the shafts were to flexed and lie angle was wrong. He recommended that I stay with the clubs I had (did not ask or push me to purchase new clubs). He recommended that he send the clubs to ping to be re-shafted (DG-S300) and lie angle adjusted(white dot), out the door about $130. Ping cleaned the clubs to, they came back looking almost new! Immediately starting hitting the ball better the first time out at the range, and the feel was soooo much better. After about 3 trips to range I was dialed in, far and straight consistently. On the course I was hitting a lot more greens and shaved about 10 strokes off the card. Get fitted!!!\n\nLessons\/Swing Analysis \n\nAbout 6 months after my fitting I was shooting low 80s. Unfortunately I got in a car accident and messed up my lower back so I was unable to play for over a year (doctors recommendation) so I basically stopped playing for three years because I got out of shape couldn't find the motivation to get back out there. Finally I got the motivation to start playing but almost completely lost my swing. Shooting low 100s, mid 90s on a good day. As you can imagine I grew extremely frustrated not being able to hit the ball like I used to. I emailed Don and decided to schedule a swing analysis, and as I expected my swing was not there anymore. I told him I was interested in lessons but had to think about it. During the analysis he gave me some pointers on my setup and take back and I immediately saw huge improvement on my next swing. I figured if he was able to do that in five minutes how much could I take from lessons? I pulled the plug and got the 10 lesson pack with 3 months of practice. I'm 4 lessons in and am seeing drastic improvements. I'm very excited to go to my lessons. Dons approach with me is great, without going into great detail he isn't dismantling my swing, he's working around my strong points so its a lot easier for me to take in and apply. And I'm able to go to the facility anytime I want to practice on the launch monitor (good way to dial in distances on your clubs) It's getting to the point that if I miss hit I know why and can correct on the course. I can't stress how happy I am with GOLFTEC and Don. If you are interested in lessons get an analysis first, if it clicks with you like it did for me, get lessons!!! Go in with an open mind, don't let ego or your hard head stop you from improving. \n\nDefinitely make an appointment. Any coaches that aren't giving lessons are usually up front and will be happy to chat with you. They can't come out and talk to you if they are busy with a student giving a lesson, that's extremely disruptive to both the coach and the student.\n\nHey, golf is expensive..... but I can certainly say that you get what you pay for with GOLFTEC.\n\nHit em straight!","date":1560348113000}

Either way, it's really nice during the week because most places close at midnight and sometimes ya just wanna stay out a little longer. They have pool tables that are charged by the hour and plenty of TVs for any game that might be on. They have projection monitors on the two wings, which is great for big games. To compliment these few good things, they have decent drink specials. Not the greatest specials, but they're worth it if it's all you're going for.\n\nThe food is bad. This place cuts the corners and they fall flat on their face because of it. The plates are actually trays, and are a tad too small to comfortably enjoy any meal. I ordered a pork sandwich, and was told that they were out. The waitress laughed about it which really annoyed me. I was ready to finish my beer and go back home but she came back and said \"I found some\".. I shouldn't have agreed. The fries tasted good, but the pork was microwaved and tasted like trash. I could microwaved dog food that would have come out better than this sandwich.\n\nIf you want a couple drinks and to watch a game or play pool, this is a great place to go. If you want food, either stay home or go somewhere else. This was the first time I've been to Fox and Hound since I've gotten yelp, but I had been here a handful of times in the past 6 months.

A boxing club, eh?  Sounded tough, and I was up for a good physical challenge.  It was free to try the first time, so I wanted to see if it was for me. \n\nThe receptionist, Brittany, was very friendly and got me all set up - she even showed me how to properly wrap up my hands with the boxing wrap - which was about $6.  Boxing gloves are supplied and there are about 30 or so punching bags hanging in the center of the club.  There are also an assortment of cardio machines, weights, medicine balls\/kettle bells, speed bags, and a small ring for coaching.\n\nI participated in one of their many group classes, the 'Power Hour.'  Geno, an ex-Colt player, was our trainer.  There was a whole spectrum of ability in our group, from the first timers (like me!) to the seasoned boxers.  He had us do a quick warmup to get the the blood flowing for the real pain to begin.  9 rounds of 2-4 min series intervals at the punching bags that will challenge even the fittest athletes.  It's very casual though, in that you can take as many breaks as you need or push the limits.  Just when I thought the suffering was over, the last 10 min was a core workout from hell.  Brutal planks, push-ups, and sit-ups.  And I thought I was in shape...\n\nMembership is about $69 per month,  but if I actually like going to the gym and have fun working out, it seems worth it.  I'll probably sign up.  If you're looking to mix up the old routine and try something new, this may be your ticket.\n\nIntensity: great energy, strength, concentration, vehemence.  It's what every great athlete needs, but the abundance in boxers is what I think makes them so impressive.  One hour at Title Boxing Club will quickly illustrate why.","date":1376365079000}

But since this is a chain store, I'm going to basically cut\/paste my standard Big Lots review here.\n\nI love Big LOTS!  (And I cannot lie.  You brothers can't deny...\")\n\nThis store is cleaner than most other Big Lots stores.\n\nYeah, they have lots of cheap Asian junk, but you can also find BARGAINS GALORE on tools and household goods.\n\nBut what keeps me going back are the CLOSE-OUTS of brand-name or equivalent-to-brand-name-quali ty FOOD ITEMS. If something doesn't sell well at major chain stores, the manufacturer still has to dump their warehouse full of stuff that the major chain stores don't want anymore. And that's where Big Lots comes in.\n\nGranted, there is often a reason why something doesn't sell at the big name chain stores and it ends up in a close-out store.  But sometimes the reason is not quality, it's just the taste of the average buyer.  And if you happen to be \"odd\" or a \"discriminating consumer\" (like me, ha-ha) and like something that the majority  doesn' t like (which happens all the time to those of us who really do have good taste, snort, snort,  :-), then you can sometimes find it at Big Lots for a GREAT PRICE!  \"OY VEY! SUCH A DEAL!\"\n\nSo here's my strategy: I shop the food aisles every week,  try a little of something I might like, and if I like it, go back the next time and buy a LOT of it, because when it's gone, it's gone.\n\nAre you a fan of Tuesday Morning?  If so, Big Lots is the lower-priced version of Tuesday Morning.  I've sometimes seen the same things on sale for cheaper at Big Lots.\n\nCaveats:  #1:  Check the expiration date of all food items before you put them in your cart. They are notorious for having out-dated food. Most everything is fine, but every once in a while they have out-dated product.  \n\nNote: I do not work at Big Lots, never have, and do not own stock in them. I just luuuuuuuuuuuuuv saving money! \n\nAlso, be aware that the actual products on the shelves will differ from store to store, because they sell out at different rates\/times.","date":1281840421000}

I was PROMISED a refund but never got it.\n\nI called back a week or two later and the manager there was no longer working there and they she they would contact the District Manager, Christian, who was supposed to call me back but I haven't heard from him AT ALL. A friend of mine works for Take 5 and texted me a screen shot of his conversation with Christian saying he was refunding me but haven't received it. \n\nI've since been able to get his number and have texted and called Christian several times and still nothing.

The froyo is always refreshing and today I enjoyed eating it at the window bar while people-watching as it drizzled outside.\n\nThe staff is always super friendly and doesn't watch me like a hawk when I try samples of the different flavors. This is important to me because I admit that sometimes I feel a little judged when I'm trying samples of the new flavors at other places, especially when they require that you ask specifically for a sample cup. They even offered me free waffle bowls twice when I walked in, and they subtracted the weight of the waffle when I weighed my bowl at the cashier---this made my day! Also, I was happy to see that they have a student discount going on until November\/December when I showed them my student ID. \n\nToday I went back and tried the pumpkin spice, pistachio, pomegranate sorbet, and strawberry cheesecake flavors. My husband fell in love instantly with his sample of strawberry cheesecake froyo so we got a big scoop of that. My personal favorite is still the original tart with diced mango, mochi, almonds, and strawberries heaped on top. The whole thing came out to less than $4 for the 2 of us!

I had good experiences the first two times and this time with Aunt Annie in town, we decided to see how they hold up to the consistency test.  We went for lunch and arrived a little before noon.  I would say they may not have been completely discovered yet.  The place was not busy on a weekday.  It did fill up somewhat before we finished our meal.  We were seated promptly and had a polite, professional and knowledgeable server.\n\nSalt + Smoke has been consistently good over the three visits.  This time we tested; ribs, brisket, pulled pork and pulled chicken.  All were very good to excellent.  The ribs were perfectly done with a good rub, perfect salt and very nice smoke.  They stack up well against any that I have had in St Louis and would compete well in Memphis.  These are the style I prefer, smoked not grilled.  \n\nThe brisket was again very good.  I ordered fatty and it was not excessively so, but was moist, tender with a flavorful bark, good peppery rub and plenty of smoke.  The rub can be plenty salty, it should be eaten with the meat as you go.  \n\nRepeating myself, I am not a knee-jerk pulled pork fan because so little of it is done well.  On this day, it was done well.  I think it is the first time I have had it here.  It was shredded and was moist and flavorful.  I can't say I have had better in St Louis, but I do know I have had a lot that is much worse.  This did not suffer from being the usual big hunks of dry roasted pork.  The pulled chicken was exactly as last time.  It was smoky, moist and very flavorful.  Ms T has made this her thing to order here, I think.\n\nSides at S+S are generally better than average.  Mac 'n' cheese is white cheddar on shells and certainly not something out of a Kraft box.  The potato salad is dressed with a mayo based dressing.  It matches my taste except for the large hunks of potato.  The pit beans were again very good.  These are savory beans, not sweet, with a lot of smoked meat shreds.  On this day they did not need salt.  I really like these.  It is nice to get something that was not just dumped out of a can with some brown sugar added.  These are clearly made in house and I believe, cooked from dry navy beans.  I would pass on the slaw with red onion and apples.  It is bland and just not what I want.  Forget the apples, omit the onion and work on a tangy dressing with some heat.  Ms T again liked the green bean and tomato salad.  She thought the dressing was different than last time.  I thought it looked over-dressed a bit.\n\nI am raising to five stars.  I said last time, that I might.  The added star is for consistency across four smoked meats, which is quite an achievement.  It is nice to have the meats all moist and salted just right.  Having some very good sides also helps.  The popovers are a nice change from a slice of light bread or sugary corn cake.  It all adds up to the best place (that I have tried) for barbecue in St Louis right now.  I hope they can maintain the consistency.","date":1423834642000}

When I dropped off my car for the repair, I mentioned that a rattle had developed on the passenger side of the car that was getting louder and wanted to know if they could take a look.  Unfortunately, Josh informed me I would have had to leave my car for a few days to diagnose the rattle, and since it's my only mode of transportation, I let it go for now.  \n\nIt turned out that the recall repair took longer than anticipated, so Josh arranged a loaner vehicle for me to use.  And since I now had another mode of transportation, he said they'd also try and find the rattle.  Well, long story short (I know, too late), Lithia worked on my car for almost a week and finally found and repaired the elusive rattle.  Even better, Josh looked up my record and my car is still under warranty (who knew?) so I only had to pay the deducible to replace a speaker.  Plus, Josh noticed it was almost time for my oil to be change, so they performed that too and saved me another trip to the service center in a few months.  \n\nI received the best customer care at the service center at Lithia.  I appreciate how they go the extra mile for customers.","date":1605282012000}

Ivan and Talia were such a pleasure to work with and were a big reason we chose Artesano. We were looking at 6 or 7 venues in the philadelphia area, and Artesano was the first one we toured. After we toured the venue and spoke to Ivan, we made our decision on the spot and cancelled the rest of our tours. Ivan truly cares about you. He makes you feel like family and is responsive and accessible. We would drop by when we were in the area or give them a random call, and Ivan and team were always there to help and chat. Wedding planning is stressful enough, but Ivan and his team make it as easy as it can be.\n\nThe people make a difference and you won't find better people to work with. We were supposed to get married May 23rd 2020, but were unable due to the COVID-19 restrictions. It was a stressful time, but Ivan was so understanding. He was flexible and was open to how we wanted to proceed. We ended up having to cancel due to the unknown of the pandemic timeline and personal reasons. Ivan refunded us all of our deposits and not once did he pressure us to consider postponing against our best interest. We'll definitely try to book an event there when life returns to normal.\n\nThe Venue: \nThe space is unique and beautiful. It feels like you're in an upscale sophisticated art gallery, but also has a homey and intimate feel. Artesano is really unlike any other venue in the area (and this is coming from an Architect). It's definitely a space that your guests won't forget. It's right on main street in Manayunk, which is an awesome neighborhood. Your guests will have a great time checking out the shops and food places on main street.\n\nThe Food:\nUsually when you go to weddings, the food is mass produced and just not great. That's not Artesano. The food is amazing. Chef Kelly definitely takes pride in her food, as every hors d'oeuvres and main course we tried left an impression. We continued to talk about how good the food was after the taste testing and our two foodie friends that came with us couldn't stop raving about it. Case in point, the vegetarian option (we chose vegetarian shepherd's pie) might have been our favorite. Usually the vegetarian draws the short end of the stick and the vegetarian dish is an afterthought. The vegetarian Shepherd's pie we tasted would make any meat lover happy.\n\nSummary:\nFeel like you understand how much we love Artesano. We really have no negatives about Artesano. You're going to get the best food, people, and value. Whether you're looking for a wedding venue or just hosting a party, Artesano is really an ideal venue.","date":1588004475000}

Last week I called and placed an order for flowers to be delivered to my mom for her birthday. My mom never mentioned the flowers, which is unlike her, so I asked her if she received them several days after her birthday. She said she didn't get anything so I called the florist the next day. The person I spoke with didn't have any information about why they weren't delivered and the charge was pending on my credit card. They took my contact information and said they would call back by the end of the day. The next day, I received a call back. The woman I spoke with explained that the ticket was accidentally placed in a pile of prom orders, but that they could still deliver the order. She apologized but never offered to discount my order as a result of the mistake. She also hurried off the phone as I tried to ask about a discount. I was frustrated but chalked it up to \"everyone makes mistakes\" and was happy that my mom would receive her flowers this week. Better late than never. It was also mother's day weekend, so I figured they were busy.\n\nThe flowers were supposed to be delivered today. I asked them to leave the order on the porch since my mom would be at work. Guess what she found when she got home today? An empty porch. \n\nWhen I called to find out why the flowers were not delivered the woman I spoke with was very rude. She said they wouldn't leave the flowers because it was too hot. I understand that but I had a missed call from the florist from this morning and they didn't leave a voicemail. They didn't bother to call my mom (they had her phone number as well). When I expressed my disappointment and asked for a refund and to cancel the order, the woman was extremely defensive and rude. The whole experience leaves a sour taste in my mouth and the communication throughout the debacle was poorly handled.\n\nDo yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere.","date":1558131497000}

I found it odd that they'd send someone who is useless when we're paying by the hour.  We received a form confirming the move from Shelby @ Big Boys Moving Company that said we would have three movers, two trips at 5-7 hours. We also gave an inventory of what needed to be moved, down to how many pieces in each room.\n They moved very slowly (I'm assuming now on purpose - the way their business seems to be run). They wrapped some pieces inside and took others outside to wrap, also a bit odd to me. They finally got most of the big furniture on the truck and our washer and dryer on the back. When we got to the new house, I immediately started finding one piece after another was damaged. Two bookcases had damage, one had a hole with a rock embedded in it, a fairly new end table has gouges and scratches, our giant wall unit entertainment center has gouges and scratches in it and was not properly put together & leveled. Our 16-year-old 57\" flat screen TV that was in perfect condition was dragged and most of the screen across the bottom was ripped and shredded and now looks horrible, we have a large standing old-fashioned jukebox that was damaged. Our king size mattress and box springs were dragged through the yard\/driveway, dirt and grass (that I had to wipe and pick off) and the mattress is now filthy and disgusting to the point where we had to buy a new one. In all, 16 pieces of furniture had damage, ranging from minor to severe. The entire move took about 10 hours (way more than we were quoted) and they only made 1 trip, instead of 2. We were given 3 wardrobe boxes, instead of the 4 in our quote. \nLast but not least, when we were given the final bill which was over $600 more than quoted.They tried to take our washer and dryer that they failed to put in our laundry room, on purpose, (even though they were the first items off) and hold them as \"ransom\" until we came up with the extra money. When we finally paid, they refused to put our washer and dryer in the laundry room and left them sitting outside. We were also charged for 10 hours, they were there from 8:20 - 5:40.  I am assuming that extra 20 minutes comes out to an hour?   \n At one point at the old house, I walked in on one of the guys who was at my nightstand. I truly believe he was going through my nightstand drawer that I forgot to empty. I startled him and he jumped up and put his hand in his pocket. I also overheard one of their employees on the phone saying \"yeah, we're about to finish this bitch house\". \nMy husband tried to contact someone several times throughout the afternoon\/evening, but couldn't reach anyone and no one responded to messages or emails. We are assuming because this was the day before Thanksgiving and they closed early. \nThey have denied any wrong doing and wouldn't even send anyone out to look at the damage. They also said that my husband signed something saying there was no damage, which was a lie (or they forged his signature). We \"fired\" them and asked them to leave before my husband signed anything. We were disgusted and exhausted at that point and wanted them gone. One of the guys told me first thing that they would be pointing out any existing damage that they see and the only thing they pointed out was on the back of our wall unit entertainment center. We bought it that way and knew about it. He pointed nothing else out because there was no other damage. \n We had to hire other movers to finish the Friday after Thanksgiving in order to have us out by our deadline, which was Saturday, November 30th.\nPLEASE DO NOT CHOOSE THIS COMPANY! I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO GO THROUGH THE NIGHTMARE WE HAD TO! WE LOST A LOT OF MONEY BETWEEN WHAT WE PAID AND ALL OF THE DAMAGES THAT THEY LEFT US WITH.","date":1579793330000}

I had heard this place described as \"casual fine dining\" and I'd say that description fits. \n\nOur server, Kristen I believe her name was, was very friendly and knowledgable, giving us info about the place (it was our first time there) and about the chef (she said his background was seafood and the seafood dishes were his specialty). Very attentive and friendly and didn't seem to mind that my wife ask her to repeat the dessert menu several times.\n\nWe started out with the Sweet Potato Nachoes which were very good. They aren't anything like tortilla chips but come topped with bacon, blue cheese (or maybe gorgonzola?) and a sweet, smoky BBQ-style sauce. My wife loved them and probably would of ordered several courses of them. I thought they were flavorful and good my only complaint was they were perfectly crispy on the outer edges but not as much the more you worked to the inside of the plate. Still quite tasty though.\n\nFor our entrees my wife had the bacon-wrapped meatloaf which has the perfect texture of mom's meatloaf growing up but flavorwise is so much better. A great dish to get and I believe the lunch special on Wednesday's.\n\nI had the ham sammie which certainly isn't a sandwich but juicy pieces of pork in a tasty (though a bit thin in my opinion) sauce and topped with apple slaw. The classic combo of pork and apple is done a little different and very well here. It also comes with a sweet potato roll (I believe that is how the menu described it) which was for me the low point of the dish. I love potato bread, mostly for its super soft and spongy qualities. These were more like large croutons that had been toasted making them crunchy. They were still delicious but I would of have preferred them softer, contrasting the crisp crunchiness of the apple slaw and being perfect little sponges to sop up the sauce from the pork.\n\nIf you have a hard time making choices then your out of luck when it comes to the dessert menu. As stated earlier our server did an excellent job of describing the items, gave her thoughts when we ask what she recommended, and was polite and patient when my wife ask, \"what was the 3rd one again?\" Ended up going with the walnut Financier with candied pecans, pecan brittle, and coffee ice cream. This dish is exactly what you want in a dessert. Each element was perfectly executed, the cake spongy, the brittle delicious (if they sold it individually I'd of bought a couple bags), the coffee ice cream creamy and just the perfect intensity. Not to strong, not to mild. A great conclusion.\n\nThe real surprise was the bill. The appetizer, the two entrees, the dessert, a soda and a 20% tip all came too..... $51. Talk about a deal. I was expecting a lot more and more very pleasantly surprised. Will definitely be back in the future to try more dishes, hope they keep the sweet potato nachoes and walnut financier around.","date":1299356715000}

Located in the Castleton area, Fox & Hound provides a safe haven for football fans and party animals alike. They have delicious food--their hamburgers are delicious and I'd recommend their chicken strips as well. I had the jalapeno bacon burger and fries and it was fantastic. Not too hot, not too weak; it was a perfect combo. This restaurant\/bar is very spacious and can accommodate large groups of people. They provide pool tables and the occasional trivia night. My meal was around $10, which I thought was reasonable. Their menu tends to hover around the $10 mark. Their drink specials will make you doe-eyed. Giant mugs of Budweiser products for only $3 on Sundays and a few other days through the week, a bloody mary bar, and an expansive domestic, import, and craft selection are all available. There's no better way to drink than with a $3 ridiculously sized beer alongside some close friends.\n\nThe serving staff was flawless. They were completely on top of their game on first football Sunday, which was amazing due to the insane amount of people in the building.

As 20-year residents of Indy, we're always happy to find local ethnic joints that remind us of our hometowns of Chicago and Pittsburgh.\n\nThe proprietor of T.O.E. is a friendly and hospitable immigrant who is generous with the free samples.  We loved the selection in the deli.  There were goods from numerous European nations, with an emphasis on Eastern Europe.  The fridge had both packaged imports and also some homemade items like strudels.  We bought some pierogies, beets with horseradish, and Swedish Fish for the kids.  My wife is half Slovak and half Irish, and I'm German and English.  Among those ethnicities, the Slovak was definitely best represented at Taste of Europe.  We would have bought some of the horseradish cheddar, but my wife had just stocked up on cheese--next time!  Also, we'll definitely order a meat & cheese platter for a future party.  It all looked so good!  If I were grading solely on the deli, T.O.E. would get 5 stars!\n\nLunch was tasty, but not stellar.  The beef goulash outshined the pork\/chicken medley, which contained some chunks of unappetizing fat.  The garlic bread was fine, but wasn't served warm.  Our meals were rustic, just as we expected.  The portions were generous, and the service was super friendly.  With only one employee (the owner), we were glad to have arrived early for lunch.  Those who came after us had to wait for awhile to be served.  The stews were fine, but next time I will opt for either the authentic grilled sausages (the Chicago Style Polish was calling my name) or the sub sandwich, which I assume is loaded with those delicious European deli meats--yum!\n\nIn all, shopping at Taste of Europe is a nostalgic and rare treat in these parts.

I was blown away by the antique furniture and architectural pieces available here.  I almost wish I had a giant house that I could just add these pieces too!\n\nOkay, from the highway (96th Street near Zionsville Road), the place doesn't look like much.  In fact, the main building looks like a simple enclosed pole barn while the the side building and the barn look in need of a lot of work.  And since it was my first visit, I found the side building rather cramped and filled with lots of fixtures, hinges, small lighting fixtures, etc.  It did have a few cool pieces (somewhat large for any old home) that caught my eye as statement pieces when I explored the back room.  The barn was unheated and had lots of old doors in various conditions.\n\nBut what I wasn't ready for turned out to be the items inside the main building.  The place is huge and I can't think of a single place I've looked at antiques that had as an impressive collection of fireplaces, bars, chandeliers, and more.  I wandered through and saw ornate details everywhere.  This building was still packed, but much easier to get around and find items.\n\nAlthough they are going to convert to a standard price tag, most of the existing pieces have a paper tag with three numbers on it.  The middle number is the price component of their system, so be advised.  \n\nNow I can't say if their prices are the best or competitive, but considering how unique some of the pieces are, I can say I haven't seen anything close to some of the pieces here.  \n\nIf you are looking for something unique to add to your home, check out this place.  Even if you don't buy something, you may be impressed with the artistic details you will find.\n\nReview #3563","date":1579526412000}

Their gluten free is a nice crispy thin crust that doesn't at all taste like gluten-free. Their toppings are super fresh and tasty. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because they have messed our order up a few times. I've learned to ask for them to repeat my order to me. They are super nice and apologetic when they have gotten my order wrong. So maybe they are not perfect, but this is a mom and pop place, rather than a large franchise, which I really like and which makes me give them room for lovely imperfection.","date":1532728755000}

They take very good care of her, she always seems happy when we drop her off and pick her up.  We drop her off and pick her up on a very irregular schedule, often in the middle of the day without warning, and every single time they are taking very good care of her, so we know it's not just for show at the end of the day, they are really good with the kids all day long.  The only thing that I am ambivalent about is the fact she has a lot of contact with older kids (they are all infants, but range from 3 months to 2 years).  When she was even smaller, they separated her a lot, with a couple of other small infants, but not 100%, she would still be close to the older kids once in a while.  This caused her to get a few colds and flu, as kids are a constant source of diseases.  So on one hand, it's good that she interacts with the other kids; on the other, it makes her sick, so I am not sure what's best...  In any case, I really like how they treat us and our daughter there, so I recommend it.","date":1459962595000}

I initially chose Big Boys Moving due to Brian Prestridge.  He was very quick to respond back from a form submission, answered my questions and more importantly gave me a fair estimate which I though was honestly to go to be true.... since a 5BR quote was what I considered A LOT OF STUFF!  My move was up in the air a bit with a couple dates and Brian was able to set my expectations properly, make my stresses subside a bit.  There was confusion on my part thinking boxes were included, but Brian let me know that Lowe's \/ HD had wide array of boxes that were inexpensive, so the adventure began in packing the house.  \n\nA few days later Susan Anderson sent me a reservation confirmation and set forth the same quote that Brian confirmed with me which also included a standard T&C agreement.  \n\nThe day of the move their team had a morning appointment that ran roughly two hours bleeding into my time, however it allowed me to get some things situated better for them, so it wasn't too much of a hassle, but I was concerned that the guys would lose a lot of daytime.  My concerns started to set in roughly about this time..., however their office called me at 10:42 to let me know it would be closer to 12:30 and then Frank called me again at 1:03 to let me know the guys were on the way.  Communication is key and with an already stressful time it went a long way in the process!\n\nNelson & Rodney showed up around 1:30 and quickly did their due-diligence process of what they were moving.  The WOW you've got a lot more than what we expected were stated and that the job was BIG.  They quickly situated the truck, began loading and never looked back.  2x 24' truck loads from my 5BR with no stairs to a 4BR with spiraled stair case with some of the heaviest stuff you can imagine they banged everything out by 8:30!!!\n\nThis was the first time I've used a moving service and was blown away by Nelson & Rodney!  Although how did Nelson grow up in NY and root for the Chicago Bulls and not the Knicks....is baffling! They not only made my 5BR move as quoted, but made it enjoyable.  Both of the guys were fun to be around, joked with my kids and dealt with really heavy furniture up two flights of stairs without a scratch.  I was very happy with my experience, would recommend them highly to friends, family and co-workers.  I can honestly say any reviews that are negative in nature found on Yelp should be questioned for legitimacy.  Have no fear with Big Boys Moving & Storage (Tampa Branch).

I was there less than 12 hours total but managed to have a horrible experience.\n\nCheck in: The guy at the desk seemed nice, but unfocused (he forgot to give me my credit card back) and a little unprofessional in my opinion - he stated an assumption that the male coworker I was traveling with and I were staying in the same room. OK, not a super crazy assumption to make, especially since I paid for his room, but you really should ask. Also, this was the 5th hotel we checked into on our trip and the first person to say that to us. Usually when you check in they tell you about breakfast, but I had to ask. Then he simply told me they had breakfast in the restaurant, and I had to ask where it was. Any one of these things wasn't a huge deal, but he left a negative impression over all.\n\nRoom: The one positive was the room was actually pretty nice. Spacious, clean and super comfortable - just like every other Holiday Inn I've ever visited.\n\nBusiness center: My coworker tried to print one file but ran into issue after issue with the internet, the printer, drivers etc., which he ended up having to resolve on his own. The internet connection in his room was also super flaky.\n\nElevators: We had to take the service elevator last night because they told us the regular ones were closed due to renovations, which was fine. Going downstairs this morning I waited for the service elevator for at least 5 minutes. While I was waiting, another guest called the normal elevators, which were right on the other side of the wall, and waited several minutes for one of those. The wait was getting ridiculous so I assumed something was broken and took the stairs - from the 7th floor, with my luggage. I wasn't happy. I later found out that the service elevator was stuck and guests were supposed to go back to using the regular elevators - I have no idea how I should've known this. There was no signage. The normal elevators were apparently just really slow and came eventually.\n\nBreakfast: This morning when I went to the restaurant, I stood in the entrance a minute or 2 before a waiter acknowledged me and the 2 other parties waiting and told us to seat ourselves. There were a lot of unoccupied tables, but most of them weren't bussed yet and had dirty dishes on them. I then had to wait a while to get a menu, and for my order to be taken. There was not a single apology the whole time. The food was fine, but fairly expensive for breakfast.\n\nI left my room at 7:40. It was almost 8:30 when I left the restaurant (and I ate pretty fast). Ridiculous! I was late for my meeting.\n\nCheck out: The lady asked if everything was fine with my stay. I said \"sure\" in a tone portrayed how I truly felt. She asked what I meant, but I told her I didn't have time to explain. That was when I decided to Yelp. Thanks for your concern, check-out lady, but you're too late.","date":1292481462000}

I spend a lot of late nights working in Houston Hall, and it's awesome to be able to walk downstairs and grab a delicious warm cookie to keep myself motivated. \n\nThe staff is really friendly and patient. I literally found them by following the smell of fresh-baked cookies, so I was a little (OK, a lot) dumb when I first walked in. They were very patient and did not laugh at my unabashed glee when they told me that ALL of their cookies are served warm. (My ordering strategy was initially to say 'please sell me whatever is making that delicious smell.' When informed that ALL of the cookies smell delicious and there was no way for them to identify the particular source, I then asked them for 'whatever cookie would be warmest.' When the answer was 'ALL OF THEM' I may have been a tad overenthused.)\n\nIf you are a Penn student I highly recommend forgetting you ever read this review until several weeks before graduation.

For $4 (or $2 for kids), you can ride the elevator up to three observation platforms.  They are located at different heights to give you multiple views of the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, which is conveniently located directly in front of the Tower.  A tour guide accompanies you and points out local points of interest, including downtown St Louis to the south and the Alton bridge to the north.\n\nThere is a also a small visitors center where you purchase admission tickets and can check out maps and informational videos.  Although the Arch is the symbolic gateway to the west, there is a lot of history located here, too.  Next time you drive up the Great River Road, check this place out!","date":1297473055000}

I gotta say this was a great present. So first, a big thank you to her for getting me this wonderful gift. I love Golf but not as much as I love you. So I thank you again.  \n\nHere's my honest take on how I feel about Golftec. Hopefully, this helps anyone interested in joining. It's got it's pros and cons and I don't believe it's a one size fits all. If you're a Golf novice, you love the game, you have an urge to learn the fundamentals, and you have the time and the cash to spend. This may be a good choice for you.  \n\nI'd recommend that you take it slow though. Learn golf etiquette, get some pointers from a Golf coach (maybe try Groupon or your local range), try to develop your own unique swing so that way you have something to improve upon once you're ready to go all-in at Golftec. \n\nOnce you check off those boxes, take a look at the packages at GT and see which one suits you best. I got a 15 lesson package, good for 12 months. In a nutshell. You pick your instructor, You pick a schedule that works for you (this can be managed via the Golftec mobile app) Each lesson is 30 minutes. During your lesson, you'll be hooked up to cables that will provide you with data on your swing. Your video analysis can be found on the GT website, so you can always go back for a refresher. Pretty cool. \n\nPractice sessions are unlimited, You can go at any time during hours of operation and practice at any Golftec location. Again, these sessions can be set up on the mobile app.   \n\nAll in all, I recommend Golftec. The packages are worth the price point. My golf game is more on the average side. The 15 lesson package was more than enough. Personally, I would've been happy with a 10 lesson package and bypassing the fitting session as I found it to be overkill. \n\nYour membership gives you access to all 180+ locations nationwide.  But please note. Not all locations are created equal. This Golftec location was the most up to date by far IMHO. Parking can be a pain though, especially if you go after 5 pm.\n\nIn closing. If you're dedicated to becoming the best golfer you can be, you take time to play regularly and you have the money to invest. Go for it. My experience at GT was solid. My coach Tony kept it fun and I enjoyed working with him. \n\nThanks for reading.","date":1578946428000}

I should have listened to my friend who told me to avoid Impact and that their pricing was shady...just skip Impact and to to a more reputable dealer like Buds Guns.  That's where I bought my gun from after Impact wasted my time.\n\nOverview of my experience: I have been trying to track down a specific firearm for about a month.  I signed up for Impact's email alerts for when it comes back in stock.  I got an email at 8am that two were available and to \"click here\" to purchase.  I clicked the link about 10 seconds after the email came in.\n\nThe link takes you to their website, which still reflects the firearm as \"out of stock.\"  It directs you to call their main 800 number...which gives you a recording that \"they're having technical difficulties\" and hangs up on you.  It then says you can email them.  I did, no response.\n\nWhen their Boise and Ogden stores open at 10am, I call both.  The guy in the Boise store...I can't think of a nice word to describe him.  He knew absolutely nothing, knew nothing about their stock, he clearly didn't want to help, and then he said to just call back later.  $2500 gun, by the way.  \n\nI called Ogden.  The woman who answered the phone there also basically knew nothing.  She asked her manager and then informed me that those two guns had released to \"100s of online dealers and would have sold out immediately.\"  She didn't actually confirm any of that.  But she was acting like we were stupid for even calling.  Again, NO interest in providing customer service or making a sale.   \n\nI asked if she knew if any gun stores that had working websites, since Impact's website, email, and main # don't work...LOL.\n\nI'll never do business with Impact and I will be sure to tell everyone I know who has firearms not to use them either.","date":1575135049000}

Plus, they couldn't heat it for us? They have tables outside to sit, but the \"hot food\" was cold or room temp, and had to be baked at home to reheat. What's the point?? Prepared salads were pricey and already wilted\/browning.\n\nFor a \"Fresh Market\" I found that little to none of the produce and meat was local. This is important to us.

Their bread gets five stars (obvs) and so does their self-serve Dawson Taylor coffee. I love their generous free samples and the giant slabs of butter they set out to go with them. They also have awesome sandwiches and pastries. The only thing I don't like about this Great Harvest is the iffy customer service. I've walked in MANY times to see a ton of people behind the counter yet no one greeted me or stepped forward to ask how they could help. Yes, eventually I got the free sample and my sandwich or whatever I was ordering that day, but sometimes it took a while, even if I was the only person there. \n\nThe great vibe that people talk about is, I guess, not my vibe. I personally don't like hearing the people who are making my sandwich talk amongst themselves like the customers are not there (I have heard, at various times, talk about concerts, boyfriends, and injuries). It makes it feel like everyone behind the counter is in a clique that everyone in front of the counter is not a part of.\n\nIn the past year or more that I've been patronizing this place, I buy coffee every time I'm in there. And every time I buy coffee, the person behind the counter tells me, \"the coffee's over there.\" Every. Single. Time. So maybe I don't have the most memorable face, but there were times I would be in there at least once a week and saw the same person who told me the same thing. Weird? Or are they just pro-gluten A.I. robots that are blankly spew the same lines over and over again?\n\nThat said, if I'm in the area, I still stop by from time to time. Not for the stellar customer service but because the coffee and the bread are so damn good.","date":1447485190000}

After doing calculations on several completed trips, I have discovered they are taking 30%+ of my earnings, and this is not including taxes, gas or car maintenance.\n\nFor instance,I had a 15 mile trip.The trip took 28 mins, not including the time it took to get to the riders location (15 mins), or the time it took to get back from the rider's destination (30 mins). \n\nOriginally, the posted earning was $26.80. The next day, I checked my earnings. It said I will be receiving $17.20. This is over 30% of my earnings BEFORE taxes\/gas\/car maintenance. I reached out to Uber for support, and received an immediate response from an automated system saying \"this issue is discussed on our help board\". \n\nIt was not discussed on the help board and I had individual questions regarding every one of my fairs. The fact that they take that much and then don't even have \"enough money\" to have someone available to answer concerns about money I made just adds icing to the cake. I eventually found an article on Forbes stating Uber had recently decided to take 30% in some areas. Funny, no notice of this change was communicated to me.\n\nUber advertises to be a valuable commodity for both riders AND drivers. If they continue with their excessive greed, I cannot see anyone wanting to drive with them. I will never use them as a rider either, due to their dishonesty in advertising (claiming they only take 20% of the driver's earnings, which in my opinion is still very high). \n\nSomeone should open an app very similar where the drivers receive a much higher % of their own money. They would make Uber's success look like  peanuts.","date":1452643002000}

I asked to speak to the owner of the dealership and I got Jeff Camara, the head salesman, it seemed to me that because the truck was paid for he could care less. He said that there was a Buy Back Program and he handed me the number for Corporate. He could care less about the defects in the paint and sent me to the Service Dept. to take pictures for Corporate. The pictures were difficult to take due to the nature of the color of the truck being black. Toni did her best. I went back in to talk to Jeff to show him the defects one more time and he then gave me the number for Ford Corporate. Then he recommended me to go to Karl Flammer Ford, Tarpon Springs.

First, the sole high point of this pharmacy is Shane, who is the only employee I've interacted with who is consistently helpful, proactive, pleasant and professional to everyone he helps. If more people like Shane were hired, it would go far to correct the many problems at this location. \n\nMost of the employees at this pharmacy either ignore your presence or bark at you as though you are severely irritating them. In the past six weeks alone I've had terrible experiences trying to fill prescriptions after giving birth to a child and following a surgery on my one month old baby -- two situations where I just really needed a simple interaction where I dropped off a prescription and received the very much needed medicines in the timeframe I was given. Instead, there were multiple interactions, both in-person and via the phone, before I could receive my prescriptions, only one of which was ready when I was told it would be. The other prescriptions were delayed for unknown reasons. Twice I was told to come back the next day for a prescription I was initially told would be ready in 30 minutes -- but only after waiting over 30 minutes, of course. \n\nAlso, I was given laughably incorrect instructions about giving medicine to my one month old baby -- did I know I needed to give the baby his medicine with food? A baby who is solely receiving breastmilk at this point in time? Very helpful advice.","date":1466632128000}

This location also is one of the largest Big Lots and has furniture. Their regular products that you can always find here: Spaghettios; A whole bunch of cereals that expire in six months or less; Oreos; Ruffies brand trash bags; A whole bunch of Latin American brand foods and flavor varieties not normally sold in the US; and SnoCaps! They also have a lot of cleaning products that tend to be of the more lower bargain end, but they also have lots of regular stuff here, like brand name brooms, mops and other cleaning supplies. \n\nThe service here is, in a word, craptastic. The people are friendly, but don't want to be there, so they really don't care. I once discovered that I whole display of mayonnaise was about two months beyond expiration, so I brought it to the attention to the cashier. She just acted like I told her that it's cold outside in winter. Really? \n\nThe great bargains are holiday stuff after the holidays. I clean up on wrapping paper after Christmas every year. 50-80% off their already ridiculously low prices. Good prices on storage stuff too. \n\nAlso, the most comfortable piece of furniture I own is a couch I got from Big Lots Furniture back when that part of the store was in a separate location. So I actually take their furniture selection (and the fact they offer layaway) very seriously. It's name brand, Simmons, although they are know more for mattresses than couches and chairs. \n\nFor more info, see Neal P.'s review. That is all!","date":1294871495000}

One set of injections and I'm fine, it took about 2 weeks to start feeling better. Where at the other group I had over five different sets of injections with not much relief at all. The staff is friendly as well. The wait in the waiting room was very short not more then 5 minutes. Thank you Dr Rogers & Sharon your the best!!","date":1527821071000}

I say finally because I have longed for a salon concept\/experience like this for years. \n\nDoes anyone else do their best to elongate the life of their hair after they leave the salon? I have gone 4 days. Day 4 wasn't pretty. This is why the concept of Breeze is so genius and has been a hot trend on the east and west coasts for a couple of years now. Get your hair professionally blown out for an event, party, important work day, or simply to feel pretty. Breeze gives you various options for styling and I just told my stylist, Jamie, to do what she felt like. \n\nFirst things first, the salon aesthetic is so clean and fresh. The color scheme is eerily similar to my wedding colors, so I might be bias, but Navy Blue and bright Olive Green complimented with clean white really conveys a modern yet elegant feel. \n\nJamie was very easy to talk with and did an incredible scalp massage while she was at it. FYI-There's a lower back pillow in the chairs that really makes it comfortable to sit back in. Rare.\n\nAfter my hair was blown out and dry we decided to add curls. Why not I say? These are some of my favorite curls and I am pretty picky when it comes to my locks. Soft, natural, and effortless looking. \n\nI'm a fan Breeze. I knew I would be. Give me a diet coke and a blow out and I'm yours.","date":1355093816000}

Even better, she's the one training the new waiters and is also a manager, and since she's been manager the service has improved immensely. The staff moves like a team; I noticed that if one waitress was busy and her table's food was ready, another who was less busy would bring the food to the table instead of leaving it sit. Where else do you get service like that?\nThis time they switched the Italian sausage on the pizza back to sweet, which is still good, and adds just as much flavor with less of a kick to the pizza.

The food is uninspired and apologetically executed.. Yes, those are technically chicken strips.. They are neither good grown up chicken strips or zany fun chicken nuggets.. They were dumped from their frozen food service bag and into a deep fryer and then put on a plate. The space is lovely and they have pool tables which are super fun but then they turn on a bunch of sport ball and crank up different sound sources so you can't have a conversation or really think over the blare of competing tv's. The bar service tries just as hard as the food service to be exceptional or exciting. I wish the name and the look of the place led the quality of the experience. I'd love a fun traditional pub type place but it seems like they would rather try to be a night spot or a sports bar that serves lousy food and boring poorly mixed drinks.","date":1444005081000}

I originally ordered a brownie with a Snickers topping and my boyfriend ordered a double chocolate chunk cookie. However, that didn't meet the $6 delivery minimum. Okay, that makes sense--the products themselves aren't THAT highly priced, so you should at least make it worth their while. We added a peanut butter chip brownie, some milk, and sat back, looking forward to a late night treat, and waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nLittle did we know how late night it would end up being!\n\nAlthough the campusfood order said that the wait would be 30 to 45 minutes, which seemed fair, the delivery didn't arrive until around 11pm, over and hour and a half after we placed the order.\n\nFurthermore, when we opened the box, it took a minute or two to figure out if one of the brownies had been forgotten. There was a small brownie square in the box, and four peanut butter chips scattered along the bottom of the box, but no apparent peanut butter chip brownie itself. That's when we realized that the \"two\" brownies were actually \"one\" square that was cut down the middle into a triangle shape for each one. And the chips had just fallen clear off of the top. All right, not TOO bad... but then they were gone in two bites. But the cookie was also horribly misshapen and the food while still warm (surprising considering the long wait?) wasn't anything that I couldn't have baked better in my own kitchen.\n\nThat is, I suppose, the price to pay for laziness ($10), but I also won't be ordering from Insomnia again.","date":1253976254000}

When we made the purchase we were told the nice thing is we could return it for a full refund within the first 100 days, minus shipping costs.  We were also told, by the sales person (who we later found was the store manager), we really should consider the mattress pad cover\/protector as that gave us a 10-year stain protection warranty.  He told us any stains on the mattress could void the warranty.  So we purchased the mattress pad protector for $197.99.  When we purchased the bed we were told there was a charge of $169.99 for delivery and set up.  Upon arriving home, I found information on-line about how easy these beds were to assemble so I called Sleep Number and arranged to have the bed delivered to my office and not set-up.  Sleep Number told me there was a $79.99 delivery fee, instead of the $169.99 fee.  Sleep Number sent me several emails confirming delivery and set-up and each time I called, Sleep Number told me the confirmations were generated by the computer and the bed was not scheduled for set-up, just delivery.\n  \nThese beds a pathetically simple.  The \"box spring\" is simple pieces of hard plastic that snap together and are covered by a piece of fabric.  The mattress is a fabric cover, with 4 pieces of foam placed around the perimeter and one piece of foam to separate to two air chambers.  A small air compressor fills the air chambers and a 1\" piece of foam covers the whole thing.  It took about 30 minutes to have completely set-up.  All in all, a very simple and cheap set-up.  \n  \nAfter about 2 weeks, neither my wife nor I were able to sleep through the night. So, we called Sleep Number to return the bed and they offered to send a free upgrade.  They sent a 3\" foam top (p6 model) for the mattress to replace the 1\" foam top (p5 model we purchased).  After the addition of the (p6 model) foam top, we were still not comfortable so we purchased, from another store, a 3\" memory foam mattress top (another ~$300) and were still unable to sleep on the Sleep Number bed.  So, we called and requested a return authorization number for the bed.  This was when we ran into problems with Sleep Number.  Sleep Number told us we could return the bed and provided return shipping labels for the return, for $119.96.  (I do not know why it costs $79.99 to ship and $119.96 to return?)  But, the mattress pad ($197.99) was not returnable and was only exchangeable in the first 30 days.  \n  \nI eventually spoke with a supervisor at Sleep Number customer service, Keith (whose sleep number is 30), and explained the problem I was having with the return.  Keith was immediately difficult to deal with.  He was sorry if we misunderstood the return policy.  When I told him we did not misunderstand, but were told simply, we could get a full refund, minus shipping, with 100 days if we were not happy, he told me that we should have read the return policy on the receipt.  I told Keith, first, we should be able to trust the salesperson (and store manager) to be honest.  The salesperson never mentioned anything about 30 days to exchange any accessories.  Keith responded by telling me he had no way to verify this (essentially calling me a liar).  Second, if the return policy is on the receipt, how can I read it before making the purchase?  Keith eventually agreed to give us another 14 days to exchange the accessories.  Keith said any differences in price would be refunded to our credit card, but he refused to allow a full refund.  When, I ask Keith if we really had to \"play that game\", I would return to the store and get the cheapest item available and get a refund for the difference, he said \"yes\".  When I asked to speak with his supervisor, he told me I could not escalate my complaint any higher than him and I would not be allowed to speak with his supervisor.\n  \nI returned to the store in King of Prussia to make the exchange.  He told me the same thing Keith told me.  And, I told him the same thing I told Keith, we should be able to trust him to be honest and if the return policy is on the receipt, we cannot read it until after the purchase is made.  I told the manage he never mentioned to us \"accessories\" were only exchangeable in the first 30 days, he had simple said 100 days for a full refund minus shipping.  The manager told me, he told us the same thing he tells all the customers.  I explained to him, if that is the case, he needs to be honest with all his customers.  \n  \nWhen we received our credit card statement we discovered Sleep Number never credited our account for the difference between delivery and set-up ($169.99) and the plain delivery ($79.99).  When I called and spoke with Tiffany (sleep number setting, 45), she told me that I was correct, Sleep Number \"forgot\" to credit the difference to my account. She said she would credit my account $76.00.  I had to explain to her the difference was not $76.00, but was $90.00, plus tax.","date":1392737084000}

I was born and raised in KC, so when I moved to STL about two years ago I was immediately on the hunt for anything that could compare to Joe's, Gates, et al. Everyone recommended Pappy's, but I was unimpressed to say the least. Sugarfire was marginally better and the sides at BBQ Saloon were good, but nothing really satisfied me until I tried this place. It's still not KC good, but it blows everything else in STL way out of the water. The burnt ends are tender, juicy and smokey. The pulled pork was also tender and smokey. And the pit beans were excellent - as good as any beans in KC. Nice smoke flavor with large chunks of meat. They also have a variety of sauces, which are all good, though they were all a little watery and somewhat overpowered by the taste of the meat. The molasses sauce doesn't seem to have much molasses in it. But that's a minor issue. Everything was great.","date":1499205226000}

Stayed here for three days after getting married at the Hillsborough County Clerks office, I believe it was in the jazz room. Fantastic for a low-key neighborhood experience.  It is the only hostel I've stayed in that has a pool and hot tub and a poolside bar--granted the pool and hot tub at my parent's house in Rio Rancho, NM are fancier but the Miller Lite\/Highlife & Corona was aligned with their beer selection. \n\nAnother very cool amenity were the free bikes; while not the best equipment we had a good time cruising around downtown Tampa and the Ybor City area. Kayaks were also available! \n\nStaff erred a little on the pervy side with the ladies at the pool. New husband commented as much about the leering\/commentary. \n\nLast feature we thoroughly enjoyed was \"the crow's nest,\" which was a treehouse structure you could climb and survey the neighborhood, drink beer, etc.  That's where I informed my parents I eloped. \n\nAs far as cleanliness goes, it was okay. We did not walk away with bedbugs or become hosts to any other parasitic entities upon check-out. It was a little grimy in the corners--like when you stay at an elderly relative's house who has bad eyesight and no cleaning lady--didn't bother me but people who are squeamish about hostels might take this into consideration.","date":1487028747000}

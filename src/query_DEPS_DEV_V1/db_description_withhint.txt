You are working with two datasets to solve this query.

Here are the descriptions of these two datasets:

1. **package_dataset** {package_query.db}  
   - This dataset is stored in SQLite database format and contains metadata of software packages, including licensing information, version release data, dependency details, and registry metadata.  
   - Fields (**Package_info** table):  
     - System (str): Package ecosystem (e.g., NPM, Maven)  
     - Name (str): Package name  
     - Version (str): Version string of the package  
     - Licenses (str): License(s) associated with the package, stored as a JSON-like array  
     - Links (str): JSON-like list of relevant links (e.g., origin, documentation, source code)  
     - Advisories (str): JSON-like list of security advisories related to the package  
     - VersionInfo (str): JSON-like object with release metadata (e.g., `IsRelease`, `Ordinal`)  
     - Hashes (str): JSON-like list of file hashes  
     - DependenciesProcessed (bool): Whether dependencies have been processed successfully  
     - DependencyError (bool): Whether a dependency processing error occurred  
     - UpstreamPublishedAt (float): Unix timestamp (ms) for when the upstream release was published  
     - Registries (str): JSON-like list of registries where the package is published  
     - SLSAProvenance (float): SLSA provenance level if available  
     - UpstreamIdentifiers (str): JSON-like list of upstream identifiers  
     - Purl (float): Package URL in purl format (if available)

2. **project_dataset** {project_query.db}  
   - This dataset is stored in DuckDB format and contains GitHub project information and mappings between projects and their package versions. It is organized into two tables:  
   - This dataset consists of two tables:
     - project_packageversion
     - Fields:  
       - System (str): Package ecosystem (e.g., NPM)  
       - Name (str): Package name  
       - Version (str): Package version string  
       - ProjectType (str): Type of project (e.g., GITHUB)  
       - ProjectName (str): Repository path in `owner/repo` format  
       - RelationProvenance (str): Provenance of the relationship data  
       - RelationType (str): Type of relationship (e.g., source repository type)  

     - project_info**  
     - Fields:  
       - Project_Information (str): Textual description of the project (may include name, owner, and general purpose)  
       - Licenses (str): License(s) associated with the project, stored as a JSON-like array  
       - Description (str): Project description field (may differ from Project_Information)  
       - Homepage (str): Homepage URL of the project, if available  
       - OSSFuzz (float): OSSFuzz status indicator (if applicable)  

### Hint 1: To solve this query, you will need to combine information from both the package and project datasets. First, match package records in **Package_info** from the package dataset with records in **project_packageversion** from the project dataset using the shared attributes *System*, *Name*, and *Version*. Then, take the *ProjectName* from **project_packageversion** and use it to find the corresponding record in **project_info**.
### Hint 2: The *Project_Information* field in **project_info** contains the project name as well as important repository metrics such as GitHub stars count and fork count, along with other descriptive details.
